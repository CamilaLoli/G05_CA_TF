This is the story of John\u0027s relationship with his family, the town, and the woman he loves; and also between the past and the present, between oppression and guilt, hate and violence, love and acceptance.","isbn10":"0060916818","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"History","title":"The Chaneysville Incident","ratings_count":"650.0","authors":"David Bradley"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-219.49148559570312,"y":294.1545104980469,"id":"1760","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dZQhiPwAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78034E+12","num_pages":"672","description":"Epic, entertaining, Stranger in a Strange Land caused controversy and uproar when it was first published.

Moore emphasizes the difficulties that inevitably accompany many relationships and focuses on the need to work through these differences in order to experience the deep reward that comes with intimacy and unconfined love.","isbn10":"0060925752","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Psychology","title":"Soul Mates","ratings_count":"4122.0","authors":"Thomas Moore"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-94.68852996826172,"y":-186.3033905029297,"id":"477","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003duYAY6WCsZgIC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1986","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","subtitle":"Three Tales of Coven Tree","num_pages":"192","description":"When a strange little man comes to the Coven Tree Church Social promising he can give people exactly what they ask for, three young believers-in-magic each make a wish that comes true in the most unexpected way.","isbn10":"0064401685","average_rating":"383.0","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"The Wish Giver","ratings_count":"2117.0","authors":"Bill Brittain"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-211.08221435546875,"y":-488.2511291503906,"id":"8","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d4oXavLNDWocC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1994","isbn13":"9,78001E+12","subtitle":"Chaos and Order","num_pages":"743","description":"A new-cover reissue of the fourth book in the bestselling five-volume sf series created by the world-famous author of the Thomas Covenant chronicles -- and acclaimed as the \u0027best work of his career\u0027.

The Black Echo (Winner of the Edgar Award for Best First Novel) For Harry Bosch-hero, loner, nighthawk-the body stuffed in a drainpipe off Mulholland Drive isn\u0027t just another statistic. This one is personal. Billy Meadows was a fellow Vietnam \"tunnel rat,\" fighting the VC and the fear they used to call the Black Echo. Harry let Meadows down once. He won\u0027t do it again. The Black Ice The corpse in the hotel room seems to be that of a missing LAPD narcotics officer. Rumors abound that the cop had crossed over-selling a new drug called Black Ice. Now Harry\u0027s making some dangerous connections, leading from the cop to a string of bloody murders, and from Hollywood Boulevard\u0027s drug bazaar to Mexico\u0027s dusty back alleys. In this lethal game, Harry is likely to be the next victim. The Concrete Blonde When Harry Bosch shot and killed Norman Church, the police were convinced it marked the end of the hunt for the Dollmaker-L.A.\u0027s most bizarre serial killer. But now Church\u0027s widow is accusing Harry of killing the wrong man-a charge that rings terrifyingly true when a new victim is discovered with the Dollmaker\u0027s macabre signature. For the second time, Harry must hunt the murderer down, before he strikes again.

By the time Goethe\u0027s Theory of Colours appeared in 1810, the wavelength theory of light and color had been firmly established. To Goethe, the theory was the result of mistaking an incidental result for an elemental principle. Far from pretending to a knowledge of physics, he insisted that such knowledge was an actual hindrance to understanding. He based his conclusions exclusively upon exhaustive personal observation of the phenomena of color. Of his own theory, Goethe was supremely confident: \"From the philosopher, we believe we merit thanks for having traced the phenomena of colours to their first sources, to the circumstances under which they appear and are, and beyond which no further explanation respecting them is possible.\" Goethe\u0027s scientific conclusions have, of course, long since been thoroughly demolished, but the intelligent reader of today may enjoy this work on quite different grounds: for the beauty and sweep of his conjectures regarding the connection between color and philosophical ideas; for an insight into early nineteenth-century beliefs and modes of thought; and for the flavor of life in Europe just after the American and French Revolutions. The book does not have to be studied to be appreciated. Goethe\u0027s subjective theory of colors permits him to speak most persuasively of color harmony and aesthetics. In some readers these notions will evoke a positive response on their merits. Others may regard them as pure fantasy, but savor the grace and style of their exposition. The work may also be read as an accurate guide to the study of color phenomena. Goethe\u0027s conclusions have been repudiated, but no one quarrels with his reporting of the facts to be observed. With simple objects--vessels, prisms, lenses, and the like--the reader will be led through a demonstration course not only in subjectively produced colors, but also in the observable physical phenomena of color. By closely following Goethe\u0027s explanations of the color phenomena, the reader may become so divorced from the wavelength theory--Goethe never even mentions it--that he may begin to think about color theory relatively unhampered by prejudice, ancient or modern.","isbn10":"0262570211","average_rating":"407.0","categories":"Art","title":"Theory of Colours","ratings_count":"669.0","authors":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe;Donald Eastlake"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":476.5956726074219,"y":-249.7047576904297,"id":"0","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dKQZCPgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78E+12","num_pages":"247","description":"A NOVEL THAT READERS and critics have been eagerly anticipating for over a decade, Gilead is an astonishingly imagined story of remarkable lives. John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It’s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames’s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family’s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather’s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend’s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames’s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life’s details, Gilead is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.","isbn10":"0002005883","average_rating":"385.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Gilead","ratings_count":"361.0","authors":"Marilynne Robinson"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-88.87145233154297,"y":276.4324645996094,"id":"1711","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d8GgmFqXKcQ4C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1999","isbn13":"9,78033E+12","subtitle":"A Storyteller\u0027s Life","num_pages":"335","description":"The story of an emotionally powerful writer and a woman of unusual strength of character.","isbn10":"0330367471","average_rating":"383.0","categories":"British","title":"Rumer Godden","ratings_count":"9.0","authors":"Anne Chisholm"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":151.86904907226562,"y":363.1313171386719,"id":"754","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d4rKpPwAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"From Beowulf to Philip Roth","num_pages":"278","description":"Frank Kermode has often said that much of his best work has been done at shorter length, in the essays he has written on a very wide range of subjects for literary journals of one kind or another.

Will human genetic engineering become commonplace? Will human cloning ever be safe? Are there many universes? How much will the climate change during the coming century? The Best American Science Writing 2002 gathers top writers and scientists covering the latest developments in the fastest-changing, farthest-reaching scientific fields, such as medicine, genetics, computer technology, evolutionary psychology, cutting-edge physics, and the environment. Among this year\u0027s selections: In \"The Made-to-Order Savior,\" Lisa Belkin spotlights two desperate families seeking an unprecedented cure by a medically and ethically unprecedented means -- creating a genetically matched child. Margaret Talbot\u0027s \"A Desire to Duplicate\" reveals that the first human clone may very likely come from an entirely unexpected source, and sooner than we think. Michael Specter reports on the shock waves rippling through the field of neuroscience following the revolutionary discovery that adult brain cells might in fact regenerate (\"Rethinking the Brain\"). Christopher Dickey\u0027s \"I Love My Glow Bunny\" recounts with sly humor a peculiar episode in which genetic engineering and artistic culture collide. Natalie Angier draws an insightful contrast between suicide terrorists and rescue workers who risk their lives, and finds that sympathy and altruism have a definite place in the evolution of human nature, David Berlinski\u0027s \"What Brings a World into Being?\" ponders the idea of biology and physics as essentially digital technologies, exploring the mysteries encoded in the universe\u0027s smallest units, be they cells or quanta. Nicholas Wade shows how one of the most controversial books of the year, The Skeptical Environmentalist, by former Greenpeace member and self-described leftist Bjorn Lomborg, debunks some of the most cherished tenets of the environmental movement, suggesting that things are perhaps not as bad as we\u0027ve been led to believe. And as a counterpoint, Darcy Frey\u0027s profile of George Divoky reveals a dedicated researcher whose love of birds and mystery leads to some sobering discoveries about global warming and forcefully reminds us of the unsung heroes of science: those who put in long hours, fill in small details, and take great trouble. In the end, the unanswered questions are what sustain scientific inquiry, open new frontiers of knowledge, and lead to new technologies and medical treatments. The Best American Science Writing 2002 is a series of exciting reports from science\u0027s front lines, where what we don\u0027t know is every bit as important as what we know.","isbn10":"0060936509","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Science","title":"The Best American Science Writing 2002","ratings_count":"66.0","authors":"Matt Ridley;Alan Lightman"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":483.3517150878906,"y":-416.3139953613281,"id":"259","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dR_LRInz7X1QC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"432","description":"Presents three stories of teenagers beset by horrible curses and strange powers.","isbn10":"0060766743","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"The Nightmare Room, Books 1-2-3: The Nightmare Begins!","ratings_count":"92.0","authors":"R.L.

After a few days of this, it was amazing how glad people were to see the kid with his magical rat pipe. And they were amazing when the rats followed hint out of town. They\u0027d have been really amazed if they\u0027d ever found out that the rats and the piper met up with a cat somewhere outside of town and solemnly counted out the money. The Amazing Maurice runs the perfect Pied Piper scam. This streetwise alley cat knows the value of cold, hard cash and can talk his way into and out of anything. But when Maurice and his cohorts decide to con the town of Bad Blinitz, it will take more than fast talking to survive the danger that awaits. For this is a town where food is scarce and rats are hated, where cellars are lined with deadly traps, and where a terrifying evil lurks beneath the hunger-stricken streets.... Set in Terry Pratchett\u0027s widely popular Discworld, this masterfully crafted, gripping read is both compelling and funny.

Bleak tools of the cold war, they embodied the rigid organization and mechanical conformity that made the military-industrial complex possible. But by the 1990s—and the dawn of the Internet—computers started to represent a very different kind of world: a collaborative and digital utopia modeled on the communal ideals of the hippies who so vehemently rebelled against the cold war establishment in the first place. From Counterculture to Cyberculture is the first book to explore this extraordinary and ironic transformation. Fred Turner here traces the previously untold story of a highly influential group of San Francisco Bay–area entrepreneurs: Stewart Brand and the Whole Earth network. Between 1968 and 1998, via such familiar venues as the National Book Award–winning Whole Earth Catalog, the computer conferencing system known as WELL, and, ultimately, the launch of the wildly successful Wired magazine, Brand and his colleagues brokered a long-running collaboration between San Francisco flower power and the emerging technological hub of Silicon Valley. Thanks to their vision, counterculturalists and technologists alike joined together to reimagine computers as tools for personal liberation, the building of virtual and decidedly alternative communities, and the exploration of bold new social frontiers. Shedding new light on how our networked culture came to be, this fascinating book reminds us that the distance between the Grateful Dead and Google, between Ken Kesey and the computer itself, is not as great as we might think.","isbn10":"0226817415","average_rating":"396.0","categories":"Social Science","title":"From Counterculture to Cyberculture","ratings_count":"323.0","authors":"Fred Turner"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-173.172607421875,"y":333.9767150878906,"id":"821","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dqUA-_xdRPgAC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"A Fragment of Life","num_pages":"640","description":"In Either/Or, using the voices of two characters - the aesthetic young man of part one, called simply \u0027A\u0027, and the ethical Judge Vilhelm of the second section - Kierkegaard reflects upon the search for a meaningful existence, contemplating subjects as diverse as Mozart, drama, boredom, and, in the famous Seducer\u0027s Diary, the cynical seduction and ultimate rejection of a young, beautiful woman.

Getting the moribund Postal Service up and running again, however, may be a near-impossible task, what with literally mountains of decades-old undelivered mail clogging every nook and cranny of the broken-down post office building; and with only a few creaky old postmen and one rather unstable, pin-obsessed youth available to deliver it.

Worst of all, it means taking on the gargantuan, money-hungry Grand Trunk clacks communication monopoly and its bloodthirsty piratical head, Mr. Reacher Gilt. But it says on the building neither rain nor snow nor glo m of ni t ...

(1871) opens on a yacht, features a remarkably unconventional heroine, and entails murder attempts, blackmail, clandestine marriage and commercial fraud. Dramatic and psychologically absorbing, the action of The Haunted Hotel (1878) takes place in an ancient Venetian palazzo converted into a modern hotel that houses a grisly secreI. Lastly, set in a beautiful water-mill, The Guilty River (1886) depicts a group of alienated characters, whose relationships threaten to erupt in violence and murder.

When Cecily Deravenel tells her eighteen-year-old son Edward of the death of his father, brother, uncle, and cousin in a fire, a part of him dies as well. Edward and his cousin Neville Watkins are suspicious of the deaths. They vow to seek the truth, avenge the deaths, and retake control of their family\u0027s business empire. As he grows into a handsome, charismatic man, Edward is torn between duty and desire. There are women in his life for whom he\u0027ll risk everything--and one woman who might destroy him. But madness and secrecy lie at the heart of the family, and Edward\u0027s enemies are far more ruthless than he knows. He will need his strength more than ever when the house of Deravenel is fatally rocked by betrayal from within. Who will become the ultimate ruler of the Deravenels? Power and money, passion and adultery, ambition and treachery all illuminate a dramatic epic saga that brings to life the glittering Edwardian Era.

Insisting on the centrality of women as historical actors and gender as a category of analysis, this work shows how the fateful political choices made by the low-country yeomanry were rooted in the politics of the household, particularly in the customary relations of power male heads of independent households assumed over their dependents, whether slaves or free women and children. Such masterly prerogatives, practiced in the domestic sphere and redeemed in the public, explain the yeomanry\u0027s deep commitment to slavery and, ultimately, their ardent embrace of secession.By placing the yeomanry in the center of the drama, McCurry offers a significant reinterpretation of this volatile society on the road to Civil War. Through careful and creative use of a wide variety of archival sources, she brings vividly to life the small worlds of yeoman households, and the larger world of the South Carolina Low Country, the plantation South, and nineteenth-century America.","isbn10":"0195117956","average_rating":"371.0","categories":"History","title":"Masters of Small Worlds","ratings_count":"96.0","authors":"Stephanie McCurry"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-341.9394836425781,"y":-90.83695983886719,"id":"1263","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dN-P6v44wHxkC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,7802E+12","num_pages":"768","description":"Features selections of the author\u0027s prose and poems, including the full texts of \"The Dunciad,\" \"The Rape of the Lock,\" and \"Peri Bathous.\"","isbn10":"019920361X","average_rating":"388.0","categories":"Poetry","title":"The Major Works","ratings_count":"207.0","authors":"Alexander Pope"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":474.9601745605469,"y":459.3781433105469,"id":"1771","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d3OwAnoLeneMC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1973","isbn13":"9,78035E+12","num_pages":"199","description":"Before Fifty Shades of Grey there was Story of O, the notorious novel of dark obsession that introduced the world to erotic fiction.

Ancient Greek and Roman society had many gods and an addiction to astrology and divination. This introduction to the period traces the process by which Christianitychanged this and so provided a foundation for the modern world: the teaching of Jesus created a lasting community, which grew to command the allegiance of the Roman emperor. Christianity is discussed in relation to how it appeared to both Jews and pagans, and how its Christian doctrine and practicewere shaped in relation to Graeco-Roman culture and the Jewish matrix. Among the major figures discussed are Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Constantine, Julian the Apostate, Basil, Ambrose, and Augustine.Following a chronological approach, Henry Chadwick\u0027s clear exposition of important texts and theological debates in their historical context is unrivalled in detail. In particular, theological and ecclesial texts are examined in relation to the behaviour and beliefs of people who attended churchesand synagogues. Christians did not find agreement and unity easy and the author displays a distinctive concern for the factors - theological, personal, and political - which caused division in the church and prevented reconciliation. The emperors, however, began to foster unity for political reasonsand to choose monotheism. Finally, the Church captured the society.","isbn10":"0199265771","average_rating":"421.0","categories":"Religion","title":"The Church in Ancient Society","ratings_count":"14.0","authors":"Henry Chadwick"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-58.26110076904297,"y":338.0439147949219,"id":"825","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dN7kyx0y1yYYC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1995","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"230","isbn10":"0140446427","average_rating":"37.0","categories":"Art","title":"What is Art?","ratings_count":"120.0","authors":"Leo Tolstoy;Richard Pevear;Larissa Volokhonsky"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":341.3992004394531,"y":432.1949157714844,"id":"1560","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dtahylzEQ78AC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"A Novel","num_pages":"441","description":"At the end of World War II the Joseph family arrives in London from Jamaica and Queenie, their white landlady, befriends them, until her racist husband, Bernard, arrives home from the front.","isbn10":"0312424671","average_rating":"393.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Small Island","ratings_count":"20087.0","authors":"Andrea Levy"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-478.3453674316406,"y":86.11909484863281,"id":"1512","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dj73yQbUYaBUC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"A Novel","num_pages":"355","description":"A group of young suburban parents, including a stay-at-home dad, a former feminist, and an obssessive-compulsive mom, finds its sleepy existence shattered when a convicted child molester moves back into town and two of the parents have an affair.","isbn10":"0312315732","average_rating":"362.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Little Children","ratings_count":"25811.0","authors":"Tom Perrotta"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":146.18014526367188,"y":132.23902893066406,"id":"180","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dznM3Eb8MZiMC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","subtitle":"Book Four of the Arthurian Saga","num_pages":"417","description":"Born of an incestuous relationship between King Arthur and his half sister, the evil sorceress Morgause, the bastard Mordred is reared in secrecy.

Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. While working to solve the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci--clues visible for all to see--yet ingeniously disguised by the painter. Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion--an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others. In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless power broker who seems to anticipate their every move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory\u0027s ancient secret--and an explosive historical truth--will be lost forever.","isbn10":"0307277674","average_rating":"382.0","categories":"Art museum curators","title":"Robert Langdon Novels","ratings_count":"1588890.0","authors":"Dan Brown"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-86.14183807373047,"y":471.6794738769531,"id":"1544","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d2CIM-IKhZmEC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"A Novel","num_pages":"379","description":"France\u0027s greatest architect, Baron Georges-EugFne Haussman, stands at the center of this unique novel about the reconstruction of Paris during the nineteenth century.

Yet beauty\u0027s visitation affects us and invites us into its rhythm, it calls us to feel, think, and act beautifully in the world: to create and live a life that awakens the Beautiful. Beauty is a gentle but urgent call to awaken. Bestselling author John O\u0027Donohue opens our eyes, hearts, and minds to the wonder of our own relationship with beauty by exposing the infinity and mystery of its breadth. His words return us to the dignity of silence, profundity of stillness, power of thought and perception, and the eternal grace and generosity of beauty\u0027s presence. In this masterful and revelatory work, O\u0027Donohue encourages our greater intimacy with beauty and celebrates it for what it really is: a homecoming of the human spirit. As he focuses on the classical, medieval, and Celtic traditions of art, music, literature, nature, and language, O\u0027Donohue reveals how beauty\u0027s invisible embrace invites us toward new heights of passion and creativity even in these uncertain times of global conflict and crisis.","isbn10":"0060957263","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Body, Mind \u0026 Spirit","title":"Beauty","ratings_count":"622.0","authors":"John O\u0027Donohue"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-373.8190002441406,"y":-220.12681579589844,"id":"1824","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dfE3XAQAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1999","isbn13":"9,78035E+12","subtitle":"The Phantom Menace : Illustrated Screenplay","num_pages":"150","description":"The complete screenplay for the latest \"Star Wars\" motion picture, which tells the story of Darth Vader\u0027s youth, includes reproductions of storyboards from the director\u0027s studio","isbn10":"0345431103","average_rating":"392.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Star Wars, Episode I","ratings_count":"257.0","authors":"George Lucas"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":461.5499572753906,"y":293.2494812011719,"id":"1346","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dHon4PwAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78026E+12","subtitle":"The History of the Lord of the Rings, Part Two","num_pages":"465","description":"Fantasy-roman.","isbn10":"0261102206","average_rating":"416.0","categories":"English fiction","title":"The Treason of Isengard","ratings_count":"93.0","authors":"John Ronald Reuel Tolkien;Christopher Tolkien"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":84.8753433227539,"y":-324.2486877441406,"id":"1753","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dMZGMGwAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2001","isbn13":"9,78034E+12","num_pages":"266","description":"This is one in a series of Famous Five reissues, illustrated with the original drawings, in full colour by Eileen Soper.","isbn10":"0340796189","average_rating":"405.0","categories":"Children\u0027s stories","title":"Five Go to Smuggler\u0027s Top","ratings_count":"11708.0","authors":"Enid Blyton"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":373.2086486816406,"y":-263.67620849609375,"id":"349","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dHKq_H_z2XsYC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1999","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"256","description":"Elijah, a biblical prophet in the Middle East during the ninth century B.C., confronts the pagan princess Jezebel and finds love in the strange land of Zarephath with a young widow, only to have his new-found happiness shattered by tragedy","isbn10":"0060930136","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Fifth Mountain","ratings_count":"749.0","authors":"Paulo Coelho"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-488.4134216308594,"y":-128.62779235839844,"id":"1","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dgA5GPgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2000","isbn13":"9,78E+12","subtitle":"A Novel","num_pages":"241","description":"A new \u0027Christie for Christmas\u0027 -- a full-length novel adapted from her acclaimed play by Charles Osborne Following BLACK COFFEE and THE UNEXPECTED GUEST comes the final Agatha Christie play novelisation, bringing her superb storytelling to a new legion of fans.

But once she meets the mysterious and alluring Edward Cullen, Isabella\u0027s life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn. Up until now, Edward has managed to keep his vampire identity a secret in the small community he lives in, but now nobody is safe, especially Isabella, the person Edward holds most dear. The lovers find themselves balanced precariously on the point of a knife-between desire and danger. Deeply romantic and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilightcaptures the struggle between defying our instincts and satisfying our desires.

Generations of philosophers, both ancient and modern, have traced their inspiration back to the presocratics, even though we have very few of their writings left. In this book, Catherine Osborne invites her readers to dip their toes into the fragmentary remains of thinkers from Thales to Pythagoras, Heraclitus to Protagoras, to try to fill in the bits of a jigsaw that has been rejigged many times and in many different ways.

Intoxicating Minds is, in the author\u0027s words, \"a grand excavation of drug myth.\" Neither extolling nor condemning drug use, it is a story of scientific and artistic achievement, war and greed, empires and religions, and lessons for the future. Ciaran Regan looks at each class of drugs, describing the historical evolution of their use, explaining how they work within the brain\u0027s neurophysiology, and outlining the basic pharmacology of those substances. From a consideration of the effect of stimulants, such as caffeine and nicotine, and the reasons and consequences of their sudden popularity in the seventeenth century, the book moves to a discussion of more modern stimulants, such as cocaine and ecstasy. In addition, Regan explains how we process memory, the nature of thought disorders, and therapies for treating depression and schizophrenia. Regan then considers psychedelic drugs and their perceived mystical properties and traces the history of placebos to ancient civilizations. Finally, Intoxicating Minds considers the physical consequences of our co-evolution with drugs -- how they have altered our very being -- and offers a glimpse of the brave new world of drug therapies.","isbn10":"0231118953","average_rating":"376.0","categories":"Philosophy","title":"Antigone\u0027s Claim","ratings_count":"406.0","authors":"Judith Butler"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":332.8389587402344,"y":174.2207794189453,"id":"775","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dANYo1XCPqt4C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1973","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"252","description":"No Marketing Blurb","isbn10":"014043089X","average_rating":"421.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"De Profundis and Other Writings","ratings_count":"2253.0","authors":"Oscar Wilde"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-360.7622985839844,"y":-339.77215576171875,"id":"1624","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dDppT-OV4Np8C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","num_pages":"344","description":"Jamie Swift and Max Holt find themselves taking on a murderer who is targeting some of the less popular citizens of Beaumont, South Carolina, when they discover that the key to the killings lies in the personal ads of the newspaper.","isbn10":"0312983301","average_rating":"382.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Full Blast","ratings_count":"12104.0","authors":"Janet Evanovich;Charlotte Hughes"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":291.0945739746094,"y":437.9651794433594,"id":"6","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dc49GQwAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1977","isbn13":"9,78001E+12","num_pages":"560","description":"Donation.","isbn10":"0006353282","average_rating":"427.0","categories":"Authors, English","title":"An Autobiography","ratings_count":"3975.0","authors":"Agatha Christie"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":427.2324523925781,"y":-230.0883026123047,"id":"145","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dQYilZGadTEYC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"400","description":"Often I feel I go to some distant region of the world to be reminded of who I really am.

In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy\u0027s fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces. Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse\u0027s crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a \"data haven\" in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe\u0027s tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn.

In welcoming the mysterious foreigner, the whole village becomes an accomplice to his sophisticated plot, which will forever mark their lives.

THE COLLECTED POETRY OF NIKKI GIOVANNI will include the complete volumes of five adult books of poetry: Black Feeling Black Talk/Black Judgement, My House, The Women and the Men, Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day, and Those Who Ride the Night Winds. Nikki self–published her first book Black Feeling, Black Talk/BlackJudgement in 1969, selling 10,000 copies; William Morrow published in 1970. Know for its iconic revolutionary phrases, it is heralded as one of the most important volumes of modern African–American poetry and is considered the seminal volume of Nikki\u0027s body of work. My House (Morrow 1972) marks a new dimension in tone and philosphy––This is Giovanni\u0027s first foray into the autobiographical. In The Women and the Men (Morrow 1975), Nikki displays her compassion for the people, things and places she has encountered––She reveres the ordinary and is in search of the extraordinary. Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day (Morrow 1978) is one of the most poignant and introspective of all Giovanni\u0027s collections. These poems chronicle the drastic change that took place during the 1970s––when the dreams of the Civil Rights era seemed to have evaporated.

The myth \"The Contendings of Horus and Seth\" is looked at in detail, and the many interpretations it has provoked are examined.

There are situations in which we fail for a moment to recognize the person we are with, in which the identity of the other is erased while we simultaneously doubt our own. That also happens with couples -- indeed, above all with couples, because lovers fear more than anything else \"losing sight\" of the loved one. With stunning artfulness in expanding and playing variations on the meaningful moment, Milan Kundera has made this situation -- and the vague sense of panic it inspires -- the very fabric of his new novel. Here brevity goes hand in hand with intensity, and a moment of bewilderment marks the start of a labyrinthine journey during which the reader repeatedly crosses the border between the real and the unreal, between what occurs in the world outside and what the mind creates in its solitude. Of all contemporary writers, only Kundera can transform such a hidden and disconcerting perception into the material for a novel, one of his finest, most painful, and most enlightening.

Whilst working as a book keeper for a meat importer, and frustrated by the range of toys in turn of the century Britain he set up a toy manufacturing company.

Do great works of the imagination originate in words or in images? Is there a rational explanation for the sudden appearance of geniuses like Mozart or Einstein? Such questions have fascinated people for centuries; only in recent years, however, has cognitive psychology been able to provide some clues to the mysterious process of creativity. In this revised edition of Notebooks of the Mind, Vera John-Steiner combines imaginative insight with scientific precision to produce a startling account of the human mind working at its highest potential. To approach her subject John-Steiner goes directly to the source, assembling the thoughts of \"experienced thinkers\"--artists, philosophers, writers, and scientists able to reflect on their own imaginative patterns. More than fifty interviews (with figures ranging from Jessica Mitford to Aaron Copland), along with excerpts from the diaries, letters, and autobiographies of such gifted giants as Leo Tolstoy, Marie Curie, and Diego Rivera, among others, provide illuminating insights into creative activity. We read, for example, of Darwin\u0027s preoccupation with the image of nature as a branched tree while working on his concept of evolution. Mozart testifies to the vital influence on his mature art of the wondrous \"bag of memories\" he retained from childhood. Anais Nin describes her sense of words as oppressive, explaining how imagistic free association freed her as a writer. Adding these personal accounts to laboratory studies of thought process, John-Steiner takes a refreshingly holistic approach to the question of creativity. What emerges is an intriguing demonstration of how specific sociocultural circumstances interact with certain personality traits to encourage the creative mind. Among the topics examined here are the importance of childhood mentor figures; the lengthy apprenticeship of the talented person; and the development of self- expression through highly individualistic languages, whether in images, movement or inner speech. Now, with a new introduction, this award-winning book provides an uniquely broad-based study of the origins, development and fruits of human inspiration.","isbn10":"0195108965","average_rating":"381.0","categories":"Psychology","title":"Notebooks of the Mind","ratings_count":"17.0","authors":"Vera John-Steiner"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-238.93585205078125,"y":251.44581604003906,"id":"1271","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dxerjugEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1996","isbn13":"9,7802E+12","subtitle":"Essentials Of Physics By Its Most Brilliant Teacher","num_pages":"176","description":"Richard P. Feynman (1918–1988) was widely recognized as the most creative physicist of the post–World War II period. His career was extraordinarily expansive. From his contributions to the development of the atomic bomb a Los Alamos during World War II to his work in quantum electrodynamics, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965, Feynman was celebrated for his brilliant and irreverent approach to physics.It was Feynman\u0027s outrageous and scintillating method of teaching that earned him legendary status among students and professors of physics. From 1961–1963, Feynman, at the California Institute of Technology, delivered a series of lectures that revolutionized the teaching of physics around the world. Six Easy Pieces, taken from the famous Lectures on Physics, represents the most accessible material from this series. In these six chapters, Feynman introduces the general reader to the following topics: atoms, basic physics, the relationship of physics to other topics, energy, gravitation, and quantum force. With his dazzling and inimitable wit, Feynman presents each discussion without equations or technical jargon.Readers will remember how—using ice water and rubber—Feynman demonstrated with stunning simplicity to a nationally televised audience the physics of the 1986 Challenger disaster. It is precisely this ability—the clear and direct illustration of complex theories—that made Richard Feynman one of the most distinguished educators in the world. Filled with wonderful examples and clever illustrations, Six Easy Pieces is the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics by one of the most admired and accessible scientists of our time.","isbn10":"0201408252","average_rating":"42.0","categories":"Science","title":"Six Easy Pieces","ratings_count":"160.0","authors":"Richard P.

In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren\u0027t as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren\u0027t those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.","isbn10":"0316172324","average_rating":"392.0","categories":"Business \u0026 Economics","title":"Blink","ratings_count":"4089.0","authors":"Malcolm Gladwell"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-189.711181640625,"y":28.960344314575195,"id":"1056","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d3jwOAQAAMAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1955","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"180","description":"\"Graham Greene centennial, 1904-2004\"--Cover.","isbn10":"0143039024","average_rating":"397.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"The quiet American","ratings_count":"35497.0","authors":"Graham Greene;Robert Stone"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":486.4077453613281,"y":388.6653137207031,"id":"1585","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dHLz1g95AXDsC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","num_pages":"966","description":"Introduces readers to the author\u0027s shorter works, spanning his entire writing career, including \"The Nine Billion Names of God,\" \"Nemesis,\" \"The Sentinel,\" and \"The Songs of Distant Earth.\"","isbn10":"0312878605","average_rating":"43.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Collected Stories of Arthur C.

The novel deals with the events of one day in Dublin, 16th June 1904, now known as \"Bloomsday\". The principal characters are Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom and his wife Molly. Ulysses has been labelled dirty, blasphemous and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it not quite obscene enough to disallow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce\u0027s \"cloacal obsession\". None of these descriptions, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains the modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in its own way) suspenseful.

This all changed, however, the night she attempts to steal a valuable item from a Palm Beach estate. Before she knew what hit her, a bomb goes off, a guard is killed, and Sam ends up saving millionaire Richard Addison. She\u0027s a good thief and will own up to her jobs, but if anyone thinks to tie her to murder, they better think again.

This Penguin Classics edition is edited by Stella McNichol with an introduction and notes by Elaine Showalter.Past, present and future are brought together one momentous June day in 1923.Clarissa Dalloway, elegant and vivacious, is preparing for a party while reminiscing about her childhood romance with Peter Walsh, and dwelling on her daughter Elizabeth\u0027s rapidly-approaching adulthood. In another part of London, war veteran Septimus Smith is shell-shocked and on the brink of madness, slowly spiralling towards self-annihilation. Their experiences mingling, yet never quite meeting, Virginia Woolf masterfully portrays a serendipitous unity of inner lives, converging as the party reaches its glittering climax. Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) is regarded as a major 20th century author and essayist, a key figure in literary history as a feminist and modernist, and the centre of \u0027The Bloomsbury Group\u0027. This informal collective of artists and writers which included Lytton Strachey and Roger Fry, exerted a powerful influence over early twentieth-century British culture. Between 1925 and 1931 Virginia Woolf produced what are now regarded as her finest masterpieces, from Mrs Dalloway(1925) to the poetic and highly experimental novel The Waves(1931). She also maintained an astonishing output of literary criticism, short fiction, journalism and biography, including the playfully subversive Orlando(1928) and A Room of One\u0027s Own(1929) a passionate feminist essay.If you enjoyed Mrs Dalloway, you might like James Joyce\u0027s Ulysses, also available in Penguin Classics.\u0027The book\u0027s celebrated stream of consciousness is one of the few genuine innovations in the history of the novel\u0027New Yorker","isbn10":"0141182490","average_rating":"379.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Mrs Dalloway","ratings_count":"2128.0","authors":"Virginia Woolf"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-162.68765258789062,"y":445.2118835449219,"id":"765","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d1P-FcgE0pcMC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1993","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"144","description":"Though no longer a fat girl, Elsie, now fifteen, still has trouble believing anyone could love her and that old fear threatens her relationship with her boyfriend.","isbn10":"0140363335","average_rating":"374.0","categories":"Obesity","title":"How Do You Lose Those Ninth-Grade Blues?","ratings_count":"10.0","authors":"Barthe DeClements"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-268.2415771484375,"y":339.2063903808594,"id":"951","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dY6EcVaBi2AAC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"797","description":"When Isabel Archer, a beautiful, spirited American is brought to Europe by her wealthy aunt Touchett, it is expected that she will soon marry.

This volume, with its erudite introduction by Mario Praz, presents three of the most celebrated Gothic novels: The Castle of Otranto, published pseudonymously in 1765, is one of the first of the genre and the most truly Gothic of the three. Vathek (1786), an oriental tale by an eccentric millionaire, exotically combines Gothic romanticism with the vivacity of The Arabian Nights and is a narrative tour de force. The story of Frankenstein (1818) and the monster he created is as spine-chilling today as it ever was; as in all Gothic novels, horror is the keynote.

She also described her own education - growing up black in largely white Germantown, Pennsylvania; studying black history and culture for the first time at Cheyney State Teachers College; and meeting the rigorous demands of the program which she graduated from in 1949. In retracing her career, Williams examines the highs and lows of urban public education since World War II.

The esay which follows the translation provides new insights into this puzzling thirteenth-century work. Musa regards Dante\u0027s intention in this so-called \"Book of Memory\" as a cruel and comic commentary on the youthful lover. He argues that Dante, using the tradition of love poetry current in his time, points up the foolishness and shallowness of his protagonist, a self-centered and self-pitying youth who only occasionally in the progress of his suffering catches even a glimpse of the true nature of Love or his beloved. \"The sensitive man who would realize a man\u0027s destiny must ruthlessly cut out of his heart the canker at its center [i.e. self-pity], the canker that the heart instinctively tends to cultivate.\" According to Musa, this is one of Dante\u0027s central ideas.

This remarkable debut book chronicles what has happened in Rwanda and neighboring states since 1994, when the Rwandan government called on everyone in the Hutu majority to murder everyone in the Tutsi minority. Though the killing was low-tech--largely by machete--it was carried out at shocking speed: some 800,000 people were exterminated in a hundred days. A Tutsi pastor, in a letter to his church president, a Hutu, used the chilling phrase that gives Philip Gourevitch his title. With keen dramatic intensity, Gourevitch frames the genesis and horror of Rwanda\u0027s \"genocidal logic\" in the anguish of its aftermath: the mass displacements, the temptations of revenge and the quest for justice, the impossibly crowded prisons and refugee camps. Through intimate portraits of Rwandans in all walks of life, he focuses on the psychological and political challenges of survival and on how the new leaders of postcolonial Africa went to war in the Congo when resurgent genocidal forces threatened to overrun central Africa. Can a country composed largely of perpetrators and victims create a cohesive national society? This moving contribution to the literature of witness tells us much about the struggle everywhere to forge sane, habitable political orders, and about the stubbornness of the human spirit in a world of extremity.

A little hapless, somewhat neurotic, sort of a hypochondriac. He\u0027s what\u0027s known as a Beta Male: the kind of fellow who makes his way through life by being careful and constant -- you know, the one who\u0027s always there to pick up the pieces when the girl gets dumped by the bigger/taller/stronger Alpha Male. But Charlie\u0027s been lucky. He owns a building in the heart of San Francisco, and runs a secondhand store with the help of a couple of loyal, if marginally insane, employees. He\u0027s married to a bright and pretty woman who actually loves him for his normalcy. And she, Rachel, is about to have their first child. Yes, Charlie\u0027s doing okay for a Beta. That is, until the day his daughter, Sophie, is born. Just as Charlie -- exhausted from the birth -- turns to go home, he sees a strange man in mint-green golf wear at Rachel\u0027s hospital bedside, a man who claims that no one should be able to see him. But see him Charlie does, and from here on out, things get really weird. . . . People start dropping dead around him, giant ravens perch on his building, and it seems that everywhere he goes, a dark presence whispers to him from under the streets. Strange names start appearing on his nightstand notepad, and before he knows it, those people end up dead, too. Yup, it seems that Charlie Asher has been recruited for a new job, an unpleasant but utterly necessary one: Death. It\u0027s a dirty job. But hey, somebody\u0027s gotta do it. Christopher Moore, the man whose Lamb served up Jesus\u0027 \"missing years\" (with the funny parts left in), and whose Fluke found the deep humor in whale researchers\u0027 lives, now shines his comic light on the undiscovered country we all eventually explore -- death and dying -- and the results are hilarious, heartwarming, and a hell of a lot of fun.","isbn10":"0060590270","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"A Dirty Job","ratings_count":"88016.0","authors":"Christopher Moore"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-300.0201721191406,"y":-136.4160919189453,"id":"123","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dMB3VSMgJ5CkC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1962","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"354","description":"A shipwrecked journalist discovers the beauty and serentity promoted by science on the island of Pala.","isbn10":"0060085495","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Island","ratings_count":"17583.0","authors":"Aldous Huxley"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-417.23858642578125,"y":114.96888732910156,"id":"363","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dehIM1VKYSWYC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2000","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","subtitle":"Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly","num_pages":"302","description":"A New York City chef and author of Gone Bamboo recounts his","isbn10":"0060934913","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Kitchen Confidential","ratings_count":"2428.0","authors":"Anthony Bourdain"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-450.7048034667969,"y":286.5425109863281,"id":"1118","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dAk83vQEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1927","isbn13":"9,78016E+12","num_pages":"242","description":"An English family\u0027s complex lives are followed and picked up again after a 10 year hiatus in order to explore the effects of time.","isbn10":"0156030470","average_rating":"377.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"To the Lighthouse","ratings_count":"488.0","authors":"Virginia Woolf"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":422.1478576660156,"y":-330.2447509765625,"id":"670","attributes":{"published_year":"1991","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"275","description":"Reissue of the famous novel based on the author\u0027s experiences as one of the TRats of Tobruk\u0027 in the Middle East during WWII.

Said\u0027s Orientalism has defined our understanding of colonialism and empire, and this Penguin Modern Classics edition contains a preface written by Said shortly before his death in 2003. In this highly-acclaimed work, Edward Said surveys the history and nature of Western attitudes towards the East, considering orientalism as a powerful European ideological creation - a way for writers, philosophers and colonial administrators to deal with the \u0027otherness\u0027 of eastern culture, customs and beliefs. He traces this view through the writings of Homer, Nerval and Flaubert, Disraeli and Kipling, whose imaginative depictions have greatly contributed to the West\u0027s romantic and exotic picture of the Orient. Drawing on his own experiences as an Arab Palestinian living in the West, Said examines how these ideas can be a reflection of European imperialism and racism. Edward W. Said (1935-2003) was a Palestinian-American cultural critic and author, born in Jerusalem and educated in Egypt and the United States. His other books include The Question of Palestine, Culture and Imperialism and Out of Place: A Memoir.

The speaker is David Kepesh, white-haired and over sixty, an eminent TV culture critic and star lecturer at a New York college - as well as an articulate propagandist of the sexual revolution. For years he has made a practice of sleeping with adventurous female students while maintaining an aesthete\u0027s critical distance. But now that distance has been annihilated. The agency of Kepesh\u0027s undoing is Consuela Castillo, the decorous, humblingly beautiful twenty-four-year-old daughter of Cuban exiles.

Yet in the space of a few short years, beginning in 1788, a group of Abolitionists moved the cause of anti-slavery to the very centre of British political life, from the floor of Parliament to the homes of 300,000 people boycotting Caribbean sugar. At their head was Thomas Clarkson, a divinity student who travelled 35,000 miles on horseback documenting abuses, talking to supporters, and evading attempts on his life. With Granville Sharp and James Phillips he founded the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, and gave platforms to freed slaves such as Olaudah Equiano, who had experienced the horrors in full.

He discusses new media\u0027s reliance on conventions of old media, such as the rectangular frame and mobile camera, and shows how new media works create the illusion of reality, address the viewer, and represent space. He also analyzes categories and forms unique to new media, such as interface and database. Manovich uses concepts from film theory, art history, literary theory, and computer science and also develops new theoretical constructs, such as cultural interface, spatial montage, and cinegratography. The theory and history of cinema play a particularly important role in the book. Among other topics, Manovich discusses parallels between the histories of cinema and of new media, digital cinema, screen and montage in cinema and in new media, and historical ties between avant-garde film and new media.","isbn10":"0262632551","average_rating":"385.0","categories":"Art","title":"The Language of New Media","ratings_count":"798.0","authors":"Lev Manovich;Roger F.

A gentle tortoiseshell cat, Kit, has been enjoying a retreat to the animal–loving actress\u0027s inn, where she\u0027s spending time with her feline friends Dulcie, and the slick tomcat sleuth, Joe Grey. But her relaxation is cut short when she hears the gunshots that end Patty\u0027s life, and sees her dead body sprawled on the inn\u0027s front steps. She glimpses the killer racing into the parking garage, and soon follows his trail. Joe and Dulcie must now follow the naïve Kit\u0027s trail, and keep her from getting into serious trouble. To complicate matters, Joe discovers that Dulcie has been hiding a runaway child––one of the lucky humans that these special cats choose to talk to––who has now been kidnapped, likely by the same man who killed their famous friend. In the end, the little girl\u0027s abduction leads them to Patty\u0027s killer, and the feline friends are all united––but they all must mourn a departed friend as they stand beside the newly laid grave of Patty Rose.","isbn10":"0060578114","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Cat Cross Their Graves","ratings_count":"481.0","authors":"Shirley Rousseau Murphy"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":18.793983459472656,"y":-60.64255905151367,"id":"947","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d6-ndr-0EMycC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"474","description":"New chronology and further reading; Tony Tanner\u0027s original introduction reinstated Edited with an introduction and notes by Flora Stafford.","isbn10":"0141439580","average_rating":"399.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Emma","ratings_count":"519245.0","authors":"Jane Austen"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":181.21676635742188,"y":98.12629699707031,"id":"530","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dCAlHAAAAMAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78007E+12","subtitle":"Encountering Death and Dying","num_pages":"664","description":"The best-selling textbook in the field, The Last Dance offers an interdisciplinary introduction to death, dying, and bereavement.

Here he is befriended by the antiquary Jonathan Oldbuck, who has taken refuge from his own personal disappointments in the obsessive study of miscellaneous history. Their slow unravelling of Lovel\u0027s true identity will unearth and redeem the secrets and lies which have devastated the guilt-haunted Earl of Glenallan, and will reinstate the tottering fortunes of Sir Arthur Wardour and his daughter Isabella. First published in 1816 in the aftermath of Waterloo, The Antiquary deals with the problem of how to understand the past so as to enable the future. Set in the tense times of the wars with revolutionary France, it displays Scott\u0027s matchless skill at painting the social panorama and in creating vivid characters, from the earthy beggar Edie Ochiltree to the loqacious and shrewdly humorous Antiquary himself.

Originally published in Romanian in 1933, this semiautobiographical novel by the world renowned scholar Mircea Eliade details the passionate awakenings of Alain, an ambitious young French engineer flush with colonial pride and prejudice and full of a European fascination with the mysterious subcontinent. Offered the hospitality of a senior Indian colleague, Alain grasps at the chance to discover the authentic India firsthand. He soon finds himself enchanted by his host\u0027s daughter, the lovely and inscrutable Maitreyi, a precocious young poet and former student of Tagore. What follows is a charming, tentative flirtation that soon, against all the proprieties and precepts of Indian society, blossoms into a love affair both impossible and ultimately tragic. This erotic passion plays itself out in Alain\u0027s thoughts long after its bitter conclusion. In hindsight he sets down the story, quoting from the diaries of his disordered days, and trying to make sense of the sad affair. A vibrantly poetic love story, Bengal Nights is also a cruel account of the wreckage left in the wake of a young man\u0027s self discovery. At once horrifying and deeply moving, Eliade\u0027s story repeats the patterns of European engagement with India even as it exposes and condemns them. Invaluable for the insight it offers into Eliade\u0027s life and thought, it is a work of great intellectual and emotional power. \"Bengal Nights is forceful and harshly poignant, written with a great love of India informed by clear-eyed understanding. But do not open it if you prefer to remain unmoved by your reading matter. It is enough to make stones weep.\" — Literary Review Mircea Eliade (1907-1986) was the Sewell L. Avery Distinguished Service Professor in the Divinity School and the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. Many of his scholarly works, as well as his two-volume autobiography and four-volume journal, are published by the University of Chicago Press. Translated into French in 1950, Bengal Nights was an immediate critical success. The film, Les Nuits Bengali, appeared in 1987.","isbn10":"0226204197","average_rating":"393.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Bengal Nights","ratings_count":"245.0","authors":"Mircea Eliade"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-121.2577133178711,"y":-359.5019226074219,"id":"715","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dyOR4QgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1996","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"492","description":"In these masterful stories, steeped in realism, Joyce creates an exacting portrait of his native city, showing how it reflects the general decline of Irish culture and civilization.

Having created it in the first place, the wizards of Unseen Univeristy feel vaguely responsible for its safety. They know the creatures who lived there escaped the impending Big Freeze by inventing the space elevator - they even intervened to rid the planet of a plague of elves, who attempted to divert humanity onto a different time track. But now it\u0027s all gone wrong - Victorian England has stagnated and the pace of progress would embarrass a limping snail. Unless something drastic is done, there won\u0027t be time for anyone to invent spaceflight and the human race will be turned into ice-pops. Why, though, did history come adrift? Was it Sir Arthur Nightingale\u0027s dismal book about natural selection? Or was it the devastating response by an obscure country vicar called Charles Darwin, whose bestselling Theology of Species made it impossible to refute the divine design of living creatures? Either way, it\u0027s no easy task to change history, as the wizards discover to their cost. Can the God of Evolution come to humanity\u0027s aid and ensure Darwin writes a very different book?

Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can\u0027t catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman\u0027s new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman\u0027s nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears.

His first book, It\u0027s Not About the Bike, charted his journey back to life and went on to become an international bestseller. Now, in his much-anticipated follow-up, Armstrong shares more details of his extraordinary life story, including the births of his twin daughters Grace and Isabel. Never shy of controversy, Armstrong offers, with typical frankness, his thoughts on training, competing, winning and failure. He also tells of the work he did for the foundation he created following his dramatic recovery, addresses the daunting challenge of living in the aftermath of cancer and treatment, and shares further inspirational tales of survival. A fresh outlook on the spirit of survivors everywhere, Every Second Counts is an account of a man who strives every day to meet life\u0027s challenges - whether on his bike or off. Every Second Counts was first published in October 2003. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in January 2013, Lance Armstrong admitted to having taken performance enhancing drugs in all seven of the Tours de France in which he competed between 1999 and 2005.

Rich with information including details from new archival material and written with the nail-biting suspense of a modern thriller, The Last Days of Henry VIII offers a superb fresh look at this fascinating figure and new insight into an intriguing chapter in history. Robert Hutchinson paints a brilliant portrait of this egotistical tyrant who governed with a ruthlessness that rivals that of modern dictators; a monarch who had \"no respect or fear of anyone in this world,\" according to the Spanish ambassador to his court. Henry VIII pioneered the modern \"show trial\": cynical propaganda exercises in which the victims were condemned before the proceedings even opened, proving the most powerful men in the land could be brought down overnight. After thirty-five years in power, Henry was a bloated, hideously obese, black-humored old recluse. And despite his having had six wives, the Tudor dynasty rested on the slight shoulders of his only male heir, the nine-year-old Prince Edward -- a situation that spurred rival factions into a deadly conflict to control the throne.

Arguably the most significant scientific discovery of the new century, the mapping of the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes that make up the human genome raises almost as many questions as it answers. Questions that will profoundly impact the way we think about disease, about longevity, and about free will. Questions that will affect the rest of your life. Genome offers extraordinary insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough. By picking one newly discovered gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine. From Huntington\u0027s disease to cancer, from the applications of gene therapy to the horrors of eugenics, Matt Ridley probes the scientific, philosophical, and moral issues arising as a result of the mapping of the genome.

Red-hot screwball comedies, each and every one of them. Nine of these stories were originally published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. All immediately went out of print and could be found only at used bookstores and yard sales. I\u0027m excited to tell you that those nine stories are now being re-released by HarperCollins. Back to the Bedroom is presented here in almost original form. I\u0027ve done only minor editing to correct some embarrassing bloopers missed the first time around. I lived in northern Virginia when I wrote Back to the Bedroom. My children were young, and we spent a lot of time visiting the Washington, D.C. museums and wandering through the historic neighborhoods. One day while strolling Capitol Hill I came upon two townhouses that captured my imagination. The houses were totally different -- a birthday cake of a house and a bran muffin of a house, and yet they shared a common wall. I wondered about the people who lived inside the houses. And eventually the houses inspired Back to the Bedroom. Back to the Bedroom is the story of a young woman with the soul of a birthday cake living in a bran muffin house -- and a nice-looking guy with the substance of a bran muffin living in a birthday cake. They share some misadventures, some romantic moments, some misunderstandings, and ultimately they turn into wedding cake. And for Plum fans, you\u0027ll be interested to find that this was the first of the four romances to feature Elsie Hawkins, the prototype for Grandma Mazur.

Queen Victoria may have usually worn black, but she loved to drink and party. The English were conned during World War II. Winston Churchill’s famous “finest hour” radio broadcast was not delivered by Winston Churchill but by Norman Shelley, an actor hired to be Churchill’s stand-in. Marie Antoinette did not say, “Let them eat cake,” Churchill didn’t coin the phrase “the Iron Curtain,” and Caesar never said, “Et tu, Brute?” Scandal in the English monarchy is nothing new: Fifteen kings fathered children out of wedlock. One queen helped depose her husband so her lover could take his place. Three English kings were gay. Eclectic, eccentric, edifying, and fun, Richard Shenkman’s eye-opening revelations prove that much of history is indeed “but a fable agreed upon.”","isbn10":"0060922559","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"History","title":"Legends, Lies \u0026 Cherished Myths of World History","ratings_count":"215.0","authors":"Richard Shenkman"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-215.64157104492188,"y":371.4920959472656,"id":"598","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d4XejAAAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,7801E+12","num_pages":"320","description":"One bitter night in January 1917, five French soldiers are court-martialled and sent into No-Man\u0027s Land.

Revealing Merton to be ‘very human’ in his chronicles of the ecstasy and torment of being in love, Learning to Love comes full circle as Merton recommits himself completely and more deeply to his vocation even as he recognizes ‘my need for love, my loneliness, my inner division, the struggle in which solitude is at once a problem and a ‘solution’.

This is the first major history of Europe to give equal weight to both East and West, and it shines light on fascinating minority communities, from heretics and lepers to Gypsies, Jews, and Muslims. It also takes an innovative approach, combining traditional narrative with unique features that help bring history alive: 299 time capsules scattered through the narrative capture telling aspects of an era. 12 -snapshots offer a panoramic look at all of Europe at a particular moment in history.

But he also inspires the respect that comes from an illustrious career, and, among many who were his colleagues and peers, he inspired friendship. The Work of Mourning is a collection that honors those friendships in the wake of passing. Gathered here are texts—letters of condolence, memorial essays, eulogies, funeral orations—written after the deaths of well-known figures: Roland Barthes, Paul de Man, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Edmond Jabès, Louis Marin, Sarah Kofman, Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-François Lyotard, Max Loreau, Jean-Marie Benoist, Joseph Riddel, and Michel Servière. With his words, Derrida bears witness to the singularity of a friendship and to the absolute uniqueness of each relationship. In each case, he is acutely aware of the questions of tact, taste, and ethical responsibility involved in speaking of the dead—the risks of using the occasion for one\u0027s own purposes, political calculation, personal vendetta, and the expiation of guilt. More than a collection of memorial addresses, this volume sheds light not only on Derrida\u0027s relation to some of the most prominent French thinkers of the past quarter century but also on some of the most important themes of Derrida\u0027s entire oeuvre-mourning, the \"gift of death,\" time, memory, and friendship itself. \"In his rapt attention to his subjects\u0027 work and their influence upon him, the book also offers a hesitant and tangential retelling of Derrida\u0027s own life in French philosophical history. There are illuminating and playful anecdotes—how Lyotard led Derrida to begin using a word-processor; how Paul de Man talked knowledgeably of jazz with Derrida\u0027s son. Anyone who still thinks that Derrida is a facetious punster will find such resentful prejudice unable to survive a reading of this beautiful work.\"—Steven Poole, Guardian \"Strikingly simpa meditations on friendship, on shared vocations and avocations and on philosophy and history.\"—Publishers Weekly","isbn10":"0226142817","average_rating":"422.0","categories":"Literary Criticism","title":"The Work of Mourning","ratings_count":"163.0","authors":"Jacques Derrida"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":72.9120864868164,"y":-369.2935485839844,"id":"673","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dt0v7jxGuSh4C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1992","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"254","description":"Reclusive writer Bill Gray escapes his failed novel into a world of political violence and terror, in a story that journeys from New York, to London, Athens, and ultimately, the bombed-out city of Beirut","isbn10":"0140152741","average_rating":"368.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Mao II","ratings_count":"8085.0","authors":"Don DeLillo"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":415.9477233886719,"y":-379.2334899902344,"id":"1783","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dNmkozwd_gfYC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1977","isbn13":"9,78035E+12","subtitle":"Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence","num_pages":"271","description":"The well-known astronomer and astrobiologist surveys current knowledge of the development of intelligence on Earth in various forms of life and explains his persuasion that intelligence must have developed along similar lines throughout the universe","isbn10":"0345346297","average_rating":"417.0","categories":"Nature","title":"The Dragons of Eden","ratings_count":"14974.0","authors":"Carl Sagan"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":262.0481262207031,"y":481.5664978027344,"id":"711","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dZA_BOPDj3-YC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1996","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"355","description":"The lives of two different couples--wealthy Los Angeles liberals Delaney and Kyra Mossbacher, and Candido and America Rincon, a pair of Mexican illegals--suddenly collide, in a story that unfolds from the shifting viewpoints of the various characters","isbn10":"014023828X","average_rating":"365.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Tortilla Curtain","ratings_count":"23410.0","authors":"T.

As the great debate proceeds, Aristophanes combines parody with slapstick and political discussion with pantomime high spirit, to produce a hilarious and unique masterpiece.","isbn10":"0140441522","average_rating":"395.0","categories":"Drama","title":"The Wasps","ratings_count":"372.0","authors":"Aristophanes"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":99.17472076416016,"y":446.8066101074219,"id":"179","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dt2pWlCpY3jQC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"240","description":"The students of Miss Earth\u0027s class in rural Vermont experience an eventful spring when they become involved with a bullying new student, a competitive egg hunt, and genetically altered chicks.","isbn10":"0060546573","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"Three Rotten Eggs","ratings_count":"76.0","authors":"Gregory Maguire"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":285.8754577636719,"y":-387.3982849121094,"id":"429","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003duatyAAAAMAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"320","description":"A former European entrepreneur recounts how she fell in love with Lketinga, a Masai warrior, while vacationing in Kenya and subsequently uprooted her life to move to the isolated bush country of Africa, where they worked to build a relationship in spite of difficult language and cultural barriers. 30,000 first printing.","isbn10":"0061131520","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"The White Masai","ratings_count":"4314.0","authors":"Corinne Hofmann"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":264.3963317871094,"y":20.550554275512695,"id":"1520","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dskqN23wn4BEC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","num_pages":"378","description":"A Yorkshire veterinarian describes the adventures and experiences of his career as he tends to sick cattle, pregnant ewes, ailing dogs, and their eccentric owners, in a celebration of the relationships between human and animal","isbn10":"0312330863","average_rating":"431.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"All Things Bright and Beautiful","ratings_count":"60280.0","authors":"James Herriot"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-90.32186126708984,"y":-514.5866088867188,"id":"681","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dR7cGAAAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1994","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"Life After Vietnam","num_pages":"400","description":"From the author of the bestselling autobiography Chickenhawk--selling over 540,000 copies--comes a triumphant sequel that reveals the Vietnam War\u0027s shattering legacy in the heart of a returning vet.

They are found in all complex living things, and in that sense, they are fundamental for driving complex life on the planet. But there is much more to them than that. Mitochondria have their own DNA, with their own small collection of genes, separate from those in the cell nucleus. It is thought that they were once bacteria living independent lives. Their enslavement within the larger cell was a turning point in the evolution of life, enabling the development of complex organisms and, closely related, the origin of two sexes. Unlike the DNA in the nucleus, mitochondrial DNA is passed down exclusively (or almost exclusively) via the female line. That\u0027s why it has been used by some researchers to trace human ancestry daughter-to-mother, to \u0027Mitochondrial Eve\u0027. Mitochondria give us important information about our evolutionary history. And that\u0027s not all. Mitochondrial genes mutate much faster than those in the nucleus because of the free radicals produced in their energy-generating role. This high mutation rate lies behind our ageing and certain congenital diseases. The latest research suggests that mitochondria play a key role in degenerative diseases such as cancer, through their involvement in precipitating cell suicide. Mitochondria, then, are pivotal in power, sex, and suicide. In this fascinating and thought-provoking book, Nick Lane brings together the latest research findings in this exciting field to show how our growing understanding of mitochondria is shedding light on how complex life evolved, why sex arose (why don\u0027t we just bud?), and why we age and die. This understanding is of fundamental importance, both in understanding how we and all other complex life came to be, but also in order to be able to control our own illnesses, and delay our degeneration and death. \u0027An extraordinary account of groundbreaking modern science...

The penultimate novel of the Rougon-Macquart cycle, La Debacle (1892) takes as its subject the dramatic events of the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune of 1870-71. During Zola\u0027s lifetime it was the bestselling of all his novels, praised by contemporaries for its epic sweep as well as its attention to historical detail. The novel seeks to explain why the Second Empire ended in a crushing military defeat and revolutionary violence. It focuses on ordinary soldiers, showing their bravery and suffering in the midst of circumstances they cannot control. Zola\u0027s descriptions are some of the most powerful he ever wrote. He skilfully integrates his narrative of events and the fictional lives of his characters to provide the finest account of this tragic chapter in the history of France.

From Gregory Maguire, the acclaimed author of Wicked, comes his much-anticipated second novel, a brilliant and provocative retelling of the timeless Cinderella tale. In the lives of children, pumpkins can turn into coaches, mice and rats into human beings.... When we grow up, we learn that it\u0027s far more common for human beings to turn into rats.... We all have heard the story of Cinderella, the beautiful child cast out to slave among the ashes. But what of her stepsisters, the homely pair exiled into ignominy by the fame of their lovely sibling? What fate befell those untouched by beauty . . . and what curses accompanied Cinderella\u0027s exquisite looks?

Iris\u0027s path quickly becomes intertwined with that of Clara, the mysterious and unnaturally beautiful girl destined to become her sister. Clara was the prettiest child, but was her life the prettiest tale? While Clara retreats to the cinders of the family hearth, burning all memories of her past, Iris seeks out the shadowy secrets of her new household--and the treacherous truth of her former life.

Now, with The Crusader, Kengor returns with the one book about Reagan that has not been written: The story of his lifelong crusade against communism, and of his dogged–and ultimately triumphant–effort to overthrow the Soviet Union. Drawing upon reams of newly declassified presidential papers, as well as untapped Soviet media archives and new interviews with key players, Kengor traces Reagan\u0027s efforts to target the Soviet Union from his days as governor of California to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of what he famously dubbed the \"Evil Empire.\" The result is a major revision and enhancement of what historians are only beginning to realize: That Reagan not only wished for the collapse of communism, but had a deep and specific understanding of what it would take––and effected dozens of policy shifts that brought the USSR to its heels within a decade of his presidency. The Crusader makes use of key sources from behind the Iron Curtain, including one key memo that implicates a major American liberal politician–still in office today–in a scheme to enlist Soviet premier Yuri Andropov to help defeat Reagan\u0027s 1984 reelection bid.

After centuries of pogrom-like riots encouraged by the Church, the Jews - who have been an important part of Spanish life since the days of the Romans - are expelled from the country by royal edict. Many who wish to remain are intimidated by Church and Crown and become Catholics, but several hundred thousand choose to retain their religion and depart; given little time to flee, some perish even before they can escape from Spain. Yonah Toledano, the 15-year-old son of a celebrated Spanish silversmith, has seen his father and brother die during these terrible days - victims whose murders go almost unnoticed in a time of mass upheaval. Trapped in Spain by circumstances, he is determined to honor the memory of his family by remaining a Jew. On a donkey named Moise, Yonah begins a meandering journey, a young fugitive zigzagging across the vastness of Spain. Toiling at manual labor, he desperately tries to cling to his memories of a vanished culture. As a lonely shepherd on a mountaintop he hurls snatches of almost forgotten Hebrew at the stars, as an apprentice armorer he learns to fight like a Christian knight. Finally, as a man living in a time and land where danger from the Inquisition is everywhere, he deals with the questions that mark his past.

Since logic is the study of correct reasoning, it is a fundamental branch of epistemology and a priority in any philosophical system. Philosophers have focused on mathematics as a case study for general philosophical issues and for its role in overall knowledge- gathering. Today, philosophy of mathematics and logic remain central disciplines in contemporary philosophy, as evidenced by the regular appearance of articles on these topics in the best mainstream philosophical journals; in fact, the last decade has seen an explosion of scholarly work in these areas. This volume covers these disciplines in a comprehensive and accessible manner, giving the reader an overview of the major problems, positions, and battle lines. The 26 contributed chapters are by established experts in the field, and their articles contain both exposition and criticism as well as substantial development of their own positions. The essays, which are substantially self-contained, serve both to introduce the reader to the subject and to engage in it at its frontiers. Certain major positions are represented by two chapters--one supportive and one critical. The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Math and Logic is a ground-breaking reference like no other in its field. It is a central resource to those wishing to learn about the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of logic, or some aspect thereof, and to those who actively engage in the discipline, from advanced undergraduates to professional philosophers, mathematicians, and historians.","isbn10":"0195325923","average_rating":"425.0","categories":"Mathematics","title":"The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic","ratings_count":"19.0","authors":"Stewart Shapiro"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-401.4540100097656,"y":-435.4622802734375,"id":"504","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dH-igY69LTxcC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1995","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"32","description":"Laura helps Ma and Pa make the little log cabin snug and cozy for the snowy days ahead. 1994 \"Pick of the Lists\" (ABA)","isbn10":"0064433730","average_rating":"428.0","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"Winter Days in the Big Woods","ratings_count":"1487.0","authors":"Laura Ingalls Wilder"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-235.53732299804688,"y":-463.8476257324219,"id":"1537","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dhcrXAQAAQBAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2007","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"A House of Night Novel","num_pages":"306","description":"Sixteen-year-old Zoey Redbird is Marked as a fledging vampyre and joins the House of Night where she will train to become an adult vampyre.","isbn10":"0312360266","average_rating":"38.0","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"Marked","ratings_count":"388266.0","authors":"P.

Who was \"just seventeen\" and made Paul\u0027s heart go \"boom\"? Was there really an Eleanor Rigby? Where\u0027s Penny Lane? In A Hard Day\u0027s Write, music journalist Steve Turner shatters many well-worn myths and adds a new dimension to the Fab Four\u0027s rich legacy by investigating for the first time the ordinary people and events immortalized in the Beatles\u0027 music and now occupying a special niche in popular culture\u0027s collective imagination. Arranged chronologically by album, the book breaks new ground by exploring how private incidents influenced the group\u0027s writing and how their music evolved. Turner reveals that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was really a drawing by Julian Lennon of his childhood friend; Bungalow Bill was an all-American tiger hunter; Doctor Robert was a New York \u0027speech doctor\u0027; and much more. A longtime Beatles admirer, Turner tracked down and interviewed the real-life subjects of the songs, probed public records and newspaper archives, and spoke in depth to the people closet to the Beatles to unearth tales that have never before been made public. The result is a book that chronicles an untold story of the Beatles themselves.

That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker\u0027s Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture.

The trial and condemnation of Socrates on charges of heresy and corrupting young minds is a defining moment in the history of Classical Athens. In tracing these events through four dialogues, Plato also developed his own philosophy, based on Socrates\u0027 manifesto for a life guided by self-responsibility. Euthyphro finds Socrates outside the court-house, debating the nature of piety, while the Apology is his robust rebuttal of the charges of impiety and a defence of the philosopher\u0027s life. In the Crito, while awaiting execution in prison, Socrates counters the arguments of friends urging him to escape. Finally, in the Phaedo, he is shown calmly confident in the face of death, skilfully arguing the case for the immortality of the soul. Hugh Tredennick\u0027s landmark 1954 translation has been revised by Harold Tarrant, reflecting changes in Platonic studies, with an introduction and expanded introductions to each of the four dialogues. Plato (c.427-347 BC) stands with Socrates and Aristotle as one of the shapers of the whole intellectual tradition of the West. He founded the Academy in Athens, the first permanent institution devoted to philosophical research and teaching, and the prototype of all Western universities. If you enjoyed The Last Days of Socrates, you might like Plato\u0027s The Symposium, also available in Penguin Classics.","isbn10":"0140449280","average_rating":"407.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Last Days of Socrates","ratings_count":"1571.0","authors":"Plato;Hugh Tredennick"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-30.03234100341797,"y":-153.68247985839844,"id":"1147","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d5AokCxyISuIC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1978","isbn13":"9,78016E+12","num_pages":"165","description":"In Kublai Khan\u0027s garden, at sunset, the young Marco Polo diverts the aged emperor from his obsession with the impending end of his empire with tales of countless cities past, present, and future","isbn10":"0156453800","average_rating":"417.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Invisible Cities","ratings_count":"39058.0","authors":"Italo Calvino"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-398.0886535644531,"y":179.0697784423828,"id":"541","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dkq8A8w_9-UcC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,7801E+12","subtitle":"The Vampire Marius","num_pages":"752","description":"Here is the gorgeous and sinister story of Marius, patrician by birth, scholar by choice, one of the oldest vampires of them all, which sweeps from his genesis in ancient Rome, in the time of the Emperor Augustus, to his meeting in the present day with a creature of snow and ice.

Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had to drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls, and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn\u0027t really a request) of his employers, Augusten landed in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey, Jr., are immediately dashed by the grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click, and that\u0027s when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life—and live it sober.

ARROW IN THE BLUE ended with his joining the Communist Party and THE INVISIBLE WRITING covers some of the most important experiences in his life. We see him in Germany, Russia, England, France and Spain, working sometimes openly and sometimes underground for the cause in which he believed. This was the time of the \u0027seven years\u0027 night\u0027 over Europe - of Hitler\u0027s spectacular successes against the Western Democracies. They were also the years of the great Russian purges, which led to Koestler#s eventual break with Communism in 1938, after Hitler and Stalin between them had claimed the lives of most of his friends and relatives. This book tells of Koestler\u0027s travels through Russia and remote parts of Soviet Central Asia and of his life as an exile. It puts in perspective his experiences in Franco\u0027s prisons under sentence of death and in concentration camps in Occupied France (told at greater length in DIALOGUE WITH DEATH AND SCUM OF THE EARTH), and ends with his escape from Occupied France in 1940 to England, where he found stability and a new home. An epilogue brings the story up to 1953, when it was written. Koestler calls the book \u0027a typical case history of a member of the educated middle classes of Central Europe in our time\u0027. It has two main themes: the historical background against which the author developed, and an unsparing analysis of his intellectual and spiritual development.","isbn10":"0099490684","average_rating":"435.0","categories":"Authors, English","title":"The Invisible Writing","ratings_count":"111.0","authors":"Arthur Koestler"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":87.10880279541016,"y":-125.99009704589844,"id":"632","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dGAqoSwAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2007","isbn13":"9,78013E+12","num_pages":"496","description":"Dispelling current myths regarding organized crime, Lyman and Potter’s fourth edition reveals a truer picture of organized crime and criminal activity today.

But in this sweeping overview of the rise of civilization, Robert O\u0027Connell finds that war is indeed an invention--an institution that arosedue to very specific historical circumstances, an institution that now verges on extinction. In Ride of the Second Horseman, O\u0027Connell probes the distant human past to show how and why war arose. He begins with a definition that distinguishes between war and mere feuding: war involves group rather than individual issues, political or economic goals, and direction by some governmentalstructure, carried out with the intention of lasting results. With this definition, he finds that ants are the only other creatures that conduct it--battling other colonies for territory and slaves. But ants, unlike humans, are driven by their genes; in humans, changes in our culture and subsistencepatterns, not our genetic hardware, brought the rise of organized warfare. O\u0027Connell draws on anthropology and archeology to locate the rise of war sometime after the human transition from nomadic hunting and gathering to agriculture, when society split between farmers and pastoralists. Around 5500BC, these pastoralists initiated the birth of war with raids on Middle Eastern agricultural settlements. The farmers responded by ringing their villages with walls, setting off a process of further social development, intensified combat, and ultimately the rise of complex urban societies dependentupon warfare to help stabilize what amounted to highly volatile population structures, beset by frequent bouts of famine and epidemic disease. In times of overpopulation, the armies either conquered new lands or self-destructed, leaving fewer mouths to feed. In times of underpopulation, slaves weretaken to provide labor. O\u0027Connell explores the histories of the civilizations of ancient Sumeria, Egypt, Assyria, China, and the New World, showing how war came to each and how it adapted to varying circumstances. On the other hand, societies based on trade employed war much more selectively andpragmatically. Thus, Minoan Crete, long protected from marauding pastoralists, developed a wealthy mercantile society marked by unmilitaristic attitudes, equality between men and women, and a relative absence of class distinctions. In Assyria, by contrast, war came to be an end in itself, in aculture dominated by male warriors. Despite the violence in the world today, O\u0027Connell finds reason for hope. The industrial revolution broke the old patterns of subsistence: war no longer serves the demographic purpose it once did. Fascinating and provocative, Ride of the Second Horseman offers a far-reaching tour of human historythat suggests the age-old cycle of war may now be near its end.","isbn10":"0195119207","average_rating":"423.0","categories":"History","title":"Ride of the Second Horseman","ratings_count":"12.0","authors":"Robert L.

The West won victory after victory, first on the battlefield and then in the marketplace. In this elegantly written volume, Bernard Lewis, a renowned authority an Islamic affairs, examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to make sense of how it had been overtaken, overshadowed, and dominated by the West. In a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil, Lewis shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry, industry, government, education, and culture.

That Sartre\u0027s study of Flaubert, The Family Idiot, is a towering achievement in intellectual history has never been disputed. Yet critics have argued about the precise nature of this novel or biography or \"criticism-fiction\" which is the summation of Sartre\u0027s philosophical, social, and literary thought. In the preface, Sartre writes: \"The Family Idiot is the sequel to Search for a Method. The subject: what, at this point in time, can we know about a man? It seemed to me that this question could only be answered by studying a specific case.\" Sartre discusses Flaubert\u0027s personal development, his relationship to his family, his decision to become a writer, and the psychosomatic crisis or \"conversion\" from his father\u0027s domination to the freedom of his art. Sartre blends psychoanalysis with a sociological study of the ideology of the period, the crisis in literature, and Flaubert\u0027s influence on the future of literature. While Sartre never wrote the final volume he envisioned for this vast project, the existing volumes constitute in themselves a unified work—one that John Sturrock, writing in the Observer, called \"a shatteringly fertile, digressive and ruthless interpretation of these few cardinal years in Flaubert\u0027s life.\" \"A virtuoso perfomance. . . . For all that this book does to make one reconsider his life, The Family Idiot is less a case study of Flaubert than it is a final installment of Sartre\u0027s mythology. . . . The translator, Carol Cosman, has acquitted herself brilliantly.\"—Frederick Brown, New York Review of Books \"A splendid translation by Carol Cosman. . . . Sartre called The Family Idiot a \u0027true novel,\u0027 and it does tell a story and eventually reach a shattering climax. The work can be described most simply as a dialectic, which shifts between two seemingly alternative interpretations of Flaubert\u0027s destiny: a psychoanalytic one, centered on his family and on his childhood, and a Marxist one, whose guiding themes are the status of the artist in Flaubert\u0027s period and the historical and ideological contradictions faced by his social class, the bourgeoisie.\"—Fredric Jameson, New York Times Book Review Jean-Paul Sartre (1906-1980) was offered, but declined, the Nobel Prize for literature in 1964. His many works of fiction, drama, and philosophy include the monumental study of Flaubert, The Family Idiot, and The Freud Scenario, both published in translation by the University of Chicago Press.","isbn10":"0226735192","average_rating":"38.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"The Family Idiot","ratings_count":"5.0","authors":"Jean-Paul Sartre"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":1.1587294340133667,"y":57.01057815551758,"id":"317","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003do2yu6uJF2SoC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"304","description":"An ambassador of the tenth-century Caliph of Bagdad is carried off by the Norsemen to endure, for three years, the harshness of their way of life and the creatures that terrorize them.","isbn10":"0060891564","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Eaters of the Dead","ratings_count":"27412.0","authors":"Michael Crichton"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":462.3588562011719,"y":-468.1004333496094,"id":"883","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d9YmI3OOxQHMC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation","num_pages":"304","description":"Stupid White Men tells you everything you need to know about how the great and the good screw us over.

Until the morning she wakes up in her mammy\u0027s living room in Dublin with stitches in her face, a dislocated knee, and completely smashed-up hands -- and no memory of how she got there.

Recuperating from her injuries, a mystified Anna returns to Manhattan.

In Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns, highly acclaimed poet and translator Daryl Hine brings to life the words of Hesiod and the world of Archaic Greece. While most available versions of these early Greek writings are rendered in prose, Hine\u0027s illuminating translations represent these early classics as they originally appeared, in verse. Since prose was not invented as a literary medium until well after Hesiod\u0027s time, presenting these works as poems more closely approximates not only the mechanics but also the melody of the originals. This volume includes Hesiod\u0027s Works and Days and Theogony, two of the oldest non-Homeric poems to survive from antiquity. Works and Days is in part a farmer\u0027s almanac—filled with cautionary tales and advice for managing harvests and maintaining a good work ethic—and Theogony is the earliest comprehensive account of classical mythology—including the names and genealogies of the gods (and giants and monsters) of Olympus, the sea, and the underworld. Hine brings out Hesiod\u0027s unmistakable personality; Hesiod\u0027s tales of his escapades and his gritty and persuasive voice not only give us a sense of the author\u0027s own character but also offer up a rare glimpse of the everyday life of ordinary people in the eighth century BCE. In contrast, the Homeric Hymns are more distant in that they depict aristocratic life in a polished tone that reveals nothing of the narrators\u0027 personalities. These hymns (so named because they address the deities in short invocations at the beginning and end of each) are some of the earliest examples of epyllia, or short stories in the epic manner in Greek. This volume unites Hine\u0027s skillful translations of the Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns—along with Hine\u0027s rendering of the mock-Homeric epic The Battle of the Frogs and the Mice—in a stunning pairing of these masterful classics.","isbn10":"0226329658","average_rating":"372.0","categories":"Poetry","title":"Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns","ratings_count":"32.0","authors":"Hesiod"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-52.133445739746094,"y":-119.67597961425781,"id":"1182","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dUs0gTQUSAvsC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78019E+12","num_pages":"229","description":"When Dorian Gray has his portrait painted, he is captivated by his own beauty.

The sound of the island\u0027s destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away. Most significant of all -- in view of today\u0027s new political climate -- the eruption helped to trigger in Java a wave of murderous anti-Western militancy among fundamentalist Muslims, one of the first outbreaks of Islamic-inspired killings anywhere.

In The Crossing, sixteen-year-old Billy Parham captures a wolf that has been marauding his family’s ranch and, instead of killing it, decides to take it on a perilous journey home to the mountains of Mexico.These two drifters come together years later in Cities of the Plain, a magnificent tale of friendship and passion.

Stunning new photographs by Nick Kelsh beautifully complement Carson\u0027s intimate account of adventures with her young nephew, Roger, as they enjoy walks along the rocky coast of Maine and through dense forests and open fields, observing wildlife, strange plants, moonlight and storm clouds, and listening to the \"living music\" of insects in the underbrush. \"If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder.\" Writes Carson, \"he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in.\" The Sense of Wonder is a refreshing antidote to indifference and a guide to capturing the simple power of discovery that Carson views as essential to life. In her insightful new introduction, Linda Lear remembers Rachel Carson\u0027s groundbreaking achievements in the context of the legendary environmentalist\u0027s personal commitment to introducing young and old to the miracles of nature. Kelsh\u0027s lush photographs inspire sensual, tactile reactions: masses of leaves floating in a puddle are just waiting to be scooped up and examined more closely. An image of a narrow path through the trees evokes the earthy scent of the woods after a summer rain. Close-ups of mosses and miniature lichen fantasy-lands will spark innocent\u0027as well as more jaded\u0027imaginations. Like a curious child studying things underfoot and within reach, Kelsh\u0027s camera is drawn to patterns in nature that too often elude hurried adults\u0027a stand of beech trees in the springtime, patches of melting snow and the ripples from a pebble tossed into a slow-moving stream. The Sense of Wonder is a timeless volume that will be passed on from children to grandchildren, as treasured as the memory of an early-morning walk when the song of a whippoorwill was heard as if for the first time.","isbn10":"006757520X","average_rating":"439.0","categories":"Nature","title":"The Sense of Wonder","ratings_count":"1160.0","authors":"Rachel Carson"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":293.2544860839844,"y":-164.3352508544922,"id":"544","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d0RCY_pd4iBsC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1998","isbn13":"9,7801E+12","num_pages":"479","description":"The Risk Pool is a thirty-year journey through the lives of Sam Hall, a small-town gambling hellraiser, and his watchful, introspective son Ned.

Although employed as a Privy Councillor at the Duke of Weimar�s court, where he helped oversee major mining, road-building and irrigation projects, he also painted, directed plays, carried out research in anatomy, botany and optics � and still found time to produce masterpieces in every literary genre. His fourteen hundred Maxims and Reflections reveal some of his deepest thought on art, ethics, literature and natural science, but also his immediate reactions to books, chance encounters or his administrative work. Although variable in quality, the vast majority have a freshness and immediacy which vividly conjure up Goethe the man.

His victories over Spain won independence for Bolivia, Panama, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Bolï¿½var became Columbia\u0027s first president in 1819. In 1822, he became dictator of Peru. Upper Peru became a separate state, which was named Bolivia in Bolï¿½var\u0027s honor, in 1825. The constitution, which he drew up for Bolivia, is one of his most important political pronouncements. Today he is remembered throughout South America, and in Venezuela and Bolivia his birthday is a national holiday. Although Bolï¿½var never prepared a systematic treatise, his essays, proclamations, and letters constitute some of the most eloquent writing not of the independence period alone, but of any period in Latin American history. His analysis of the region\u0027s fundamental problems, ideas on political organization and proposals for Latin American integration are relevant and widely read today, even among Latin Americans of all countries and of all political persuasions.

Now, in Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining. \"Believing in Jesus does not mean believing doctrines about him,\" Borg writes. \"Rather, it means to give one\u0027s heart, one\u0027s self at its deepest level, to . . . the living Lord.\" Drawing on his own journey from a naive, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life—one not rooted in creeds or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community. In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus\u0027 character: spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement founder. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus, showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith. For questioning believers, doubters, and reluctant unbelievers alike, Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time frees our understanding of Jesus\u0027 life and message from popular misconceptions and outlines the way to a sound and contemporary faith: \"For ultimately, Jesus is not simply a figure of the past, but a figure of the present. Meeting that Jesus—the living one who comes to us even now—will be like meeting Jesus again for the first time.\"","isbn10":"0060609176","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Religion","title":"Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time","ratings_count":"3998.0","authors":"Marcus J.

Considered a prodigy in scientific research, he surprised everyone and himself by setting his sights on the competitive world of high finance. Yet no sooner had he landed an entry-level position at a prestigious firm than Gardner found himself caught in a web of incredibly challenging circumstances that left him as part of the city\u0027s working homeless and with a toddler son. Motivated by the promise he made to himself as a fatherless child to never abandon his own children, the two spent almost a year moving among shelters, \"HO-tels,\" soup lines, and even sleeping in the public restroom of a subway station. Never giving in to despair, Gardner made an astonishing transformation from being part of the city\u0027s invisible poor to being a powerful player in its financial district. More than a memoir of Gardner\u0027s financial success, this is the story of a man who breaks his own family\u0027s cycle of men abandoning their children. Mythic, triumphant, and unstintingly honest, The Pursuit of Happyness conjures heroes like Horatio Alger and Antwone Fisher, and appeals to the very essence of the American Dream.","isbn10":"0061750581","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"The Pursuit of Happyness","authors":"Chris Gardner"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-276.57781982421875,"y":-401.2162170410156,"id":"874","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dW9p21K45kkwC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"304","description":"Setting the record straight about her life as a novelist (less glitz and glamour than sitting alone in a darkened bedroom with a laptop in front of her) Marian Keyes here presents a selection of her articles.

It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about visionary companies.\" So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time. Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: \"What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?\" What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter \u0026 Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world\u0027s best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked? By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies. Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.","isbn10":"0060566108","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Business \u0026 Economics","title":"Built to Last","ratings_count":"49529.0","authors":"Jim Collins;Jerry I.

Their good-humored search yields surprising discoveries about turkey sex life and overly zealous zucchini plants, en route to a food culture that\u0027s better for the neighborhood and also better on the table.

Despite the efforts of more than four hundred police officers and homicide investigators, the heinous crime was never solved.

Wolfe discovers startling new evidence—buried in the files of the Los Angeles District Attorney\u0027s Office for more than half a century.

But Wolfe goes even further to unravel the large-scale cover-up behind the case.

I was too scared to even look at my father. I didn\u0027t want to see the disappointment and horror on his face. All that hate I had accumulated for him over the years, all the resentment against him for not understanding what I was going through, just released with the tears. \"So, where are your parents?\" the stewardess asked me after a few minutes. \"I can\u0027t wait here with you much longer.\" I looked up and wiped my eyes. My father was standing ten feet away. He didn\u0027t even recognize me. In the underbelly of Las Vegas, a cesspool of warring biker gangs and seedy strip clubs transformed the gawky, brace-faced Jenna Massoli into the bombshell Jenna Jameson. Today, Jenna Jameson is the biggest star in the history of adult movies, consistently ranked as one of the most beautiful women alive. But behind the glamour and the meteoric rise to fame was a path paved with tragedy and heartbreak. As a teenager drawn into a chaotic world ruled by rape, abuse, and murder, Jenna plunged into a downward spiral of addiction, even as she became one of the most photographed women in adult magazines. Determined to overcome this past, Jenna rebounded in the adult-film business, where she encountered sadistic directors, experienced lovers of both sexes, amorous celebrities (from Howard Stern to Marilyn Manson to Tommy Lee), bitter rival starlets, and finally, glory, as she went on to become the biggest porn star the world has ever seen. But her struggle for happiness did not end when the accolades began. For years she wrestled with her resentment at her estranged father, the loneliness of growing up from the age of two without a mother, and her enduring childhood desire to find a man who could give her the security and love she never had. Her unforgettable memoir is many things at once: a shocking sexual history, an insider\u0027s guide to the secret workings of the billion-dollar adult-film industry, and a gripping thriller that probes deep into Jenna\u0027s dark past. An unparalleled exploration of sexual freedom, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star ventures far beyond the flesh, into the heart-shredding tragedies and adrenaline-pumping triumphs of a woman who has already lived a hundred lifetimes. Always witty and humorous even as she faces the demons of her past, Jenna offers hilarious anecdotes about one of the most controversial businesses in history, and shares outrageous advice, including her ten commandments of dating and sex, how to become a \"suitcase pimp,\" and how to make it in the business as a female (or a male). Add to this never-before-seen photographs from Jenna\u0027s private collection and others taken exclusively for this book, and the result is certain to be one of the most talked-about books of the year.","isbn10":"0060539097","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star","ratings_count":"10211.0","authors":"Jenna Jameson;Neil Strauss"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":425.8349914550781,"y":270.4706726074219,"id":"1268","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dstaKxp3zWVEC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,7802E+12","subtitle":"From Apostolic Times until the Council of Florence","num_pages":"316","description":"The greatest Christian split of all has been that between east and west, between Roman Catholic and eastern Orthodox, which is still apparent today.

Ranging from the picaresque to the satirical, Cervantes\u0027s Exemplary Stories defy the conventions of heroic chivalric literature through a combination of comic irony, moral ambiguity, realism, and sheer mirth. With acute narrative skill and deft characterisation, drawing on colloquial language and farce, Cervantes creates a tension between the everyday and the literary, the plausible and the improbable. While encouraging us to reach our own moral conclusions, he also persuades us to accept the coincidental and the incredible: two boys indulge their life of crime at a time of public prayer; a young nobleman undergoes a change of identity at the behest of not a princess but a mere gipsy girl, and, most fantastically, talking dogs philosophize in a ward full of syphilitics. By placing the extraordinary within the contexts of the ordinary, the Exemplary Stories chart new novelistic territory and demonstrate Cervantes at his most imaginative and innovative.

In the hands of Rolling Stone writer Neil Strauss and illustrator Bernard Chang, this adult graphic novel weaves together black humor and blacker reality. Like all great American stories, it features humble beginnings, life–changing tragedy, stripping, abuse, implants, fame, addiction, bigger implants, abduction, gunplay, downfall, and even bigger implants. Not to mention a thousand shades of latex and L\u0027Oreal. Part parody, part morality tale, here is the truth about the porn life, its outsized visual splendor captured in a comic parade of doe–eyed centerfolds, its essence distilled in a story that will haunt every reader who has ever wondered where his next fantasy is coming from.","isbn10":"0060884053","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Comics \u0026 Graphic Novels","title":"How to Make Money Like a Porn Star","ratings_count":"159.0","authors":"Neil Strauss;Bernard Chang"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":173.92709350585938,"y":-118.64289855957031,"id":"1283","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d95Zpl8C0-wYC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78023E+12","num_pages":"200","description":"For this fiftieth-anniversary edition, Dahl has written an extensive new afterword that reevaluates Madisonian theory in light of recent research.

This Penguin Shakespeare edition is edited by Peter Davison with an introduction by Adrian Poole. Angered by the loss of his son in battle, the Earl of Northumberland supports another rebellion against King Henry IV, bringing the country to the brink of civil war. Sick and weary, the old King sends out his forces, including the unruly Sir John Falstaff, to meet the rebels. But as the conflict grows, he must also confront a more personal problem - how to make his reprobate son Prince Hal aware of the duties he must bear, as heir to the throne. This book contains a general introduction to Shakespeare\u0027s life and Elizabethan theatre, a separate introduction to Henry IV Part II, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, an essay discussing performance options on both stage and screen, and a commentary. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was born to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden some time in late April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. He wrote about 38 plays (the precise number is uncertain), many of which are regarded as the most exceptional works of drama ever produced, including Romeo and Juliet (1595), Henry V (1599), Hamlet (1601), Othello (1604), King Lear (1606) and Macbeth (1606), as well as a collection of 154 sonnets, which number among the most profound and influential love-poetry in English.

It is also one of the best introductions to Deleuze\u0027s thought, establishing many of his central philosophical positions. In Nietzsche and Philosophy, Deleuze identifies and explores three crucial concepts in Nietzschean thought-multiplicity, becoming, and affirmation-and clarifies Nietzsche\u0027s views regarding the will to power, eternal return, nihilism, and difference. For Deleuze, Nietzsche challenged conventional philosophical ideas and provided a means of escape from Hegel\u0027s dialectical thinking, which had come to dominate French philosophy. He also offered a path toward a politics of difference.

The book that has it all is The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis. But Lewis did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia. For the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations. This edition presents all seven books -- unabridged -- in one impressive volume. The books are presented here according to Lewis\u0027 preferred order, each chapter graced with an illustration by the original artist, Pauline Baynes.

Crammed with catastrophe, terror, and ghostly interventions, the novel was an immediate success, and influenced numerous followers. These include William Beckford\u0027s Vathek (1786), which alternates grotesque comedy with scenes of exotic magnificence in the story of the ruthless Caliph Vathek\u0027s journey to damnation. The Monk (1796), by Matthew Lewis, is a violent tale of ambition, murder, and incest, set in the sinister monastery of the Capuchins in Madrid. Frankenstein (1818, 1831) is Mary Shelley\u0027s disturbing and perennially popular tale of young student who learns the secret of giving life to a creature made from human relics, with horrific consequences. This collection illustrates the range and the attraction of the Gothic novel.

Grant – a man who managed to end the Civil War on a note of grace, serve two terms as president, write one of the most successful military memoirs in American literature, and is today remembered as a brilliant general but a failed president. Ulysses S. Grant was the first officer since George Washington to become a four–star general in the United States Army, and the only president between Andrew Jackson and Woodrow Wilson to serve eight consecutive years in the White House. In this succinct and vivid biography, Michael Korda considers Grant\u0027s character and reconciles the conflicting evaluations of his leadership abilities. Grant\u0027s life played out as a true Horatio Alger story. Despite his humble background as the son of a tanner in Ohio, his lack of early success in the army, and assorted failed business ventures, his unwavering determination propelled him through the ranks of military leadership and into the presidency. But while the general\u0027s tenacity and steadfastness contributed to his success on the battlefield, it both aided and crippled his effectiveness in the White House. Assessing Grant both within the context of his time and in contrast to more recent American leaders, Korda casts a benevolent eye on Grant\u0027s presidency while at the same time conceding his weaknesses. He suggests that though the general\u0027s second term ended in financial and political scandals, the fact remains that for eight years Grant exerted a calming influence on a country that had only just emerged from a horrendous civil war. Ulysses S. Grant is an even–handed and stirring portrait of a man who guided America through a pivotal juncture in its history.","isbn10":"0060590157","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Ulysses S.

But the Seawolves coaches won\u0027t give up on him. They bring Jack back to Cape Marlin, determined to help him rediscover his lost talent. He finds himself again under the summer sun, coaches and old friends standing by him. But in the end it will be up to Jack.

In this, the first volume, Manchester follows Churchill from his birth to 1932, when he began to warn against the re-militarization of Germany. Born of an American mother and the gifted but unstable son of a duke, his childhood was one of wretched neglect. He sought glory on the battlefields of Cuba, Sudan, India, South Africa and the trenches of France. In Parliament he was the prime force behind the creation of Iraq and Jordan, laid the groundwork for the birth of Israel, and negotiated the independence of the Irish Free State. Yet, as Chancellor of the Exchequer he plunged England into economic crisis, and his fruitless attempt to suppress Gandhi\u0027s quest for Indian independence brought political chaos to Britain. Throughout, Churchill learned the lessons that would prepare him for the storm to come, and as the 1930\u0027s began, he readied himself for the coming battle against Nazism--an evil the world had never before seen.","isbn10":"0316545031","average_rating":"443.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Last Lion, The: Volume 1","ratings_count":"328.0","authors":"William Manchester"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-242.49478149414062,"y":-14.647747993469238,"id":"1375","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dRU1_QgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2001","isbn13":"9,78029E+12","num_pages":"164","description":"It has always been a pleasure to me to watch the flowers and insects in their struggle to keep alive.

Impeccably researched, filled with page-turning romance, passion, and scandal, Sex with the Queen explores the scintillating sexual lives of some of our most beloved and infamous female rulers. She was the queen, living in an opulent palace, wearing lavish gowns and dazzling jewels. She was envied, admired, and revered. She was also miserable, having been forced to marry a foreign prince sight unseen, a royal ogre who was sadistic, foaming at the mouth, physically repulsive, mentally incompetent, or sexually impotent—and in some cases all of the above. How did queens find happiness? In courts bristling with testosterone—swashbuckling generals, polished courtiers, and virile cardinals—many royal women had love affairs. Anne Boleyn flirted with courtiers; Catherine Howard slept with one. Henry VIII had both of them beheaded. Catherine the Great had her idiot husband murdered, and ruled the Russian empire with a long list of sexy young favorites. Marie Antoinette fell in love with the handsome Swedish count Axel Fersen, who tried valiantly to rescue her from the guillotine. Empress Alexandra of Russia found emotional solace in the mad monk Rasputin. Her behavior was the spark that set off the firestorm of the Russian revolution. Princess Diana gave up her palace bodyguard to enjoy countless love affairs, which tragically led to her early death. When a queen became sick to death of her husband and took a lover, anything could happen—from disgrace and death to political victory. Some kings imprisoned erring wives for life; other monarchs obligingly named the queen\u0027s lover prime minister. The crucial factor deciding the fate of an unfaithful queen was the love affair\u0027s implications in terms of power, money, and factional rivalry.

Whether covering the three-ring circus of a vicious presidential race, plunging into the wars between dictionary writers, or confronting the World\u0027s Largest Lobster Cooker at the annual Maine Lobster Festival, Wallace projects a quality of thought that is uniquely his and a voice as powerful and distinct as any in American letters.","isbn10":"0316156116","average_rating":"425.0","categories":"Literary Criticism \u0026 Collections","title":"Consider the Lobster","ratings_count":"30787.0","authors":"David Foster Wallace"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":17.676979064941406,"y":-350.4977111816406,"id":"465","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dFbDVDnPRXKoC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1993","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"304","description":"This vivid and detailed biography strips away centuries of distortion and myth and presents a balanced view of the man whose religion continues to dramatically affect the course of history.","isbn10":"0062508865","average_rating":"415.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Muhammad","ratings_count":"4795.0","authors":"Karen Armstrong"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-229.70663452148438,"y":-12.017376899719238,"id":"852","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dZVqH94OVeWAC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1978","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"64","description":"Lentil\u0027s harmonica playing saves the day when calamity threatens the homecoming celebration for the leading citizen of Alto, Ohio.","isbn10":"0140502874","average_rating":"412.0","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"Lentil","ratings_count":"3982.0","authors":"Robert McCloskey"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":237.93466186523438,"y":257.5625305175781,"id":"1726","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dwaXVYKG0FFEC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78033E+12","num_pages":"256","description":"Dwight is only twenty-eight, but he\u0027s having a midlife crisis.

They bring alive her family and friends, her surroundings and contemporary events with a freshness unparalleled in modern biographies. Above all we recognize the unmistakable voice of the author of such novels as Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. We see the shift in her writing from witty and amusing descriptions of the social life of town and country, to a thoughtful and constructive tone while writing about the business of literary composition. R.W. Chapman\u0027s ground-breaking edition of the collected Letters first appeared in 1932, and a second edition followed twenty years later. Now in this third edition of Jane Austen\u0027s Letters, Deirdre Le Faye has added new material that has come to light since 1952, and re-ordered the letters into their correct chronological sequence. She has provided discreet and full annotation to each letter, including its provenance, and information on the watermarks, postmarks, and other physical details of the manuscripts, together with new biographical, topographical, and general indexes. Teachers, students, and fans of Jane Austen, at all levels, will find remarkable insight into one of the most popular novelists ever.","isbn10":"0192832972","average_rating":"415.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Jane Austen\u0027s Letters","ratings_count":"2211.0","authors":"Jane Austen"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":497.2937316894531,"y":1.0230891704559326,"id":"1377","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dnf_eDyxtbD0C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1967","isbn13":"9,78029E+12","num_pages":"191","description":"A major figure in the history of post-Revolutionary literature in Mexico, Juan Rulfo received international acclaim for his brilliant short novel Pedro Páramo (1955) and his collection of short stories El llano en llamas (1953), translated as a collection here in English for the first time.

Although these women are part of a modernizing middle class, they also voluntarily adopt a traditional symbol of female subordination. How can this paradox be explained? An explanation emerges which reconceptualizes what appears to be reactionary behavior as a new style of political struggle--as accommodating protest. These women, most of them clerical workers in the large government bureaucracy, are ambivalent about working outside the home, considering it a change which brings new burdens as well as some important benefits. At the same time they realize that leaving home and family is creating an intolerable situation of the erosion of their social status and the loss of their traditional identity. The new veiling expresses women\u0027s protest against this. MacLeod argues that the symbolism of the new veiling emerges from this tense subcultural dilemma, involving elements of both resistance and acquiescence.","isbn10":"023112189X","average_rating":"396.0","categories":"Literary Criticism","title":"William Faulkner","ratings_count":"4.0","authors":"Nicolas Tredell"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-482.305419921875,"y":39.29195022583008,"id":"1270","attributes":{"published_year":"1975","isbn13":"9,7802E+12","num_pages":"454","isbn10":"020106894X","average_rating":"432.0","categories":"Kinetic theory of gases","title":"Thermodynamics, Kinetic Theory, and Statistical Thermodynamics","ratings_count":"38.0","authors":"Francis Weston Sears;Gerhard Ludwig Salinger"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":430.7804870605469,"y":-173.6715545654297,"id":"1645","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d2FLxMwEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2007","isbn13":"9,78032E+12","subtitle":"A Novel","num_pages":"769","description":"The men on board HMS Terror have every expectation of triumph. As part of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, the first steam-powered vessels ever to search for the legendary Northwest Passage, they are as scientifically supported an enterprise as has ever set forth. As they enter a second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships buckling in the grip of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror constantly clawing to get in.When the expedition\u0027s leader, Sir John Franklin, meets a terrible death, Captain Francis Crozier takes command and leads his surviving crewmen on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the ice. With them travels an Inuit woman who cannot speak and who may be the key to survival, or the harbinger of their deaths. But as another winter approaches, as scurvy and starvation grow more terrible, and as the terror on the ice stalks them southward, Crozier and his men begin to fear that there is no escape. The Terror swells with the heart-stopping suspense and heroic adventure that have won Dan Simmons praise as \"a writer who not only makes big promises but keeps them\" (Seattle Post-Intelligencer). With a haunting and constantly surprising story based on actual historical events, The Terror is a novel that will chill you to your core.","isbn10":"0316017442","average_rating":"405.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Terror","ratings_count":"28640.0","authors":"Dan Simmons"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-84.38909149169922,"y":346.7759094238281,"id":"1509","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d3Q-XD02f4oQC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"Autobiography","num_pages":"368","description":"Personal anecdotes, humorous reminiscences, and more than one thousand photographs and illustrations celebrate the popular comedy troupe that began in 1969.","isbn10":"0312311451","average_rating":"408.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"The Pythons","ratings_count":"73.0","authors":"Graham Chapman;John Cleese;Terry Gilliam;Michael Palin;Eric Idle;Terry Jones"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-315.5680236816406,"y":-240.04270935058594,"id":"571","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003diXmFAAAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,7801E+12","num_pages":"240","description":"\"In this entrancing first collection of stories, a master storyteller focuses on a fresh and fascinating range of human behaviour, revealing himself as an even more versatile and accomplished writer than his acclaimed novels have shown.

From his home in Spain he journeys to the markets of Tangiers and across the Egyptian desert to a fateful encounter with the alchemist.

Of all contemporary writers, only Kundera can transform such a hidden and disconcerting perception into the material for a novel, one of his finest, most painful, and most enlightening.

The Akallabeth recounts the downfall of the great island kingdom of Numenor at the end of the Second Age and Of the Rings of Power tells of the great events at the end of the Third Age, as narrated in The Lord of the Rings.

O these fashionable people!\u0027 Frances Burney\u0027s first and most enduringly popular novel is a vivid, satirical, and seductive account of the pleasures and dangers of fashionable life in late eighteenth-century London. As she describes her heroine\u0027s entry into society, womanhood and, inevitably, love, Burney exposes the vulnerability of female innocence in an image-conscious and often cruel world where social snobbery and sexual aggression are played out in the public arenas of pleasure-gardens, theatre visits, and balls. But Evelina\u0027s innocence also makes her a shrewd commentator on the excesses and absurdities of manners and social ambitions - as well as attracting the attention of the eminently eligible Lord Orville. Evelina, comic and shrewd, is at once a guide to fashionable London, a satirical attack on the new consumerism, an investigation of women\u0027s position in the late eighteenth century, and a love story. The new introduction and full notes to this edition help make this richness all the more readily available to a modern reader.","isbn10":"0192840312","average_rating":"366.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Evelina, Or, The History of a Young Lady\u0027s Entrance Into the World","ratings_count":"11701.0","authors":"Fanny Burney"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":481.9482116699219,"y":-476.9830627441406,"id":"496","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d2lybT5x8FCsC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2000","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"252","description":"Swan Song Like the rest of his family, Louis is a trumpeter swan.

Kennedy\u0027s Profiles in Courage, Giorgio Vasari\u0027s Lives of the Artists, and Samuel Johnson\u0027s Lives of the Poets are classic celebrations of the greatest, the brightest, the eternally constellated. Paul Collins\u0027 Banvard\u0027s Folly is a different kind of book. Here are thirteen unforgettable portraits of forgotten people: men and women who might have claimed their share of renown but who, whether from ill timing, skullduggery, monomania, the tinge of madness, or plain bad luck-or perhaps some combination of them all-leapt straight from life into thankless obscurity. Among their number are scientists, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, from across the centuries and around the world. They hold in common the silenced aftermath of failure, the name that rings no bells. Collins brings them back to glorious life. John Banvard was an artist whose colossal panoramic canvasses (one behemoth depiction of the entire eastern shore of the Mississippi River was simply known as \"The Three Mile Painting\") made him the richest and most famous artist of his day. . . before he decided to go head to head with P. T. Barnum. René Blondot was a distinguished French physicist whose celebrated discovery of a new form of radiation, called the N-Ray, went terribly awry. At the tender age of seventeen, William Henry Ireland signed \"William Shakespeare\" to a book and launched a short but meteoric career as a forger of undiscovered works by the Bard -- until he pushed his luck too far. John Symmes, a hero of the War of 1812, nearly succeeded in convincing Congress to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where he intended to prove his theory that the earth was hollow and ripe for exploitation; his quixotic quest counted Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe among its greatest admirers. Collins\u0027 love for what he calls the \"forgotten ephemera of genius\" give his portraits of these figures and the other nine men and women in Banvard\u0027s Folly sympathetic depth and poignant relevance. Their effect is not to make us sneer or revel in schadenfreude; here are no cautionary tales. Rather, here are brief introductions-acts of excavation and reclamation-to people whom history may have forgotten, but whom now we cannot.","isbn10":"0312300336","average_rating":"397.0","categories":"History","title":"Banvard\u0027s Folly","ratings_count":"498.0","authors":"Paul Collins"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-356.1993103027344,"y":230.8848419189453,"id":"188","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dYdaFEb_LE9YC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"336","description":"The Perennial Philosophy is defined by its author as \"The metaphysic that recognizes a divine Reality substantial to the world of things and lives and minds.\" With great wit and stunning intellect, Aldous Huxley examines the spiritual beliefs of various religious traditions and explains them in terms that are personally meaningful.","isbn10":"006057058X","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Philosophy","title":"The Perennial Philosophy","ratings_count":"2959.0","authors":"Aldous Huxley"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-366.0198669433594,"y":-512.1032104492188,"id":"682","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dk9sfdC_z4IkC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1992","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"John Wesley Powell and the Second Opening of the West","num_pages":"438","description":"Biography of John Wesley Powell.","isbn10":"0140159940","average_rating":"407.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Beyond the Hundredth Meridian","ratings_count":"2870.0","authors":"Wallace Stegner"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-438.35430908203125,"y":308.8925476074219,"id":"1466","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003ddhK7wAEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1999","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"With Related Documents","num_pages":"184","description":"This is an edition of The Communist Manifesto with related documents.

And I expected to cause a shock.\"--Jean-Jacques Pauvert, from the Introduction When Story of O was first published in 1954 in Paris by Jean-Jacques Pauvert, it narrowly escaped censorship by the Department of the Interior and eventually became the most widely translated French novel in the world. It describes in cool, elegant language the experiences of a young woman as she willingly enters a dark maze of perverse sexual practices within a clandestine amoral society. Revelling in pure fantasy, its theme is total submission through love to excesses of sadism and masochism, and the bond of \"ownership.\" Now Doris Kloster, a photographer specializing in issues of women\u0027s sexuality and power, has realized a long-standing dream. She has created a photographic representation of one of the most famous and controversial erotic novels ever published. The result is another sensation. The Illustrated Story of O presents over 50 superb images which mirror perfectly the intense eroticism of the novel. Shooting entirely in Paris and its environs, Doris Kloster has succeeded in matching characters, locations, costumes and props to the original descriptions. And each magnificent color photograph is accompanied by a short extract from the novel. In addition, there is a Preface from Doris Kloster herself and an Introduction from Jean-Jacques Pauvert, the original publisher of the novel. The Illustrated Story of O presents a rich visual feast that will delight fans of Doris Kloster\u0027s work, and appeal strongly to connoisseurs of the darker excesses of sexuality.

Together with the shorter recollections of James Edward\u0027s two sisters, Anna Lefroy and Caroline Austen, the Memoir remains the prime authority for her life and continues to inform all subsequent accounts. These are family memories, the record of Jane Austen\u0027s life shaped and limited by the loyalties, reserve, and affection of nieces and nephews recovering in old age the outlines of the young aunt they had each known. They still remembered the shape of her bonnet and the tone of her voice, and their first-hand accounts bring her vividly before us. Their declared partiality also raises fascinating issues concerning biographical truth, and the terms in which all biography functions.

The Witch of the Waste was another matter. After fifty years of quiet, it was rumored that the Witch was about to terrorize the country again. So when a moving black castle, blowing dark smoke from its four thin turrets, appeared on the horizon, everyone thought it was the Witch. The castle, however, belonged to Wizard Howl, who, it was said, liked to suck the souls of young girls. The Hatter sisters--Sophie, Lettie, and Martha--and all the other girls were warned not to venture into the streets alone. But that was only the beginning. In this giant jigsaw puzzle of a fantasy, people and things are never quite what they seem. Destinies are intertwined, identities exchanged, lovers confused. The Witch has placed a spell on Howl. Does the clue to breaking it lie in a famous poem? And what will happen to Sophie Hatter when she enters Howl\u0027s castle?

And the Conclave of Shadows, charged unexpectedly with the training of two apprentices, must also best powerful agents of the darkest magic . . . for the fate of two worlds lies in the balance. The New York Times bestselling author and master of fantasy Raymond E. Feist returns to his signature world of Midkemia in this first book in a gripping new trilogy that ushers in the third, and most dramatic, Riftwar yet: the Darkwar. In the middle of the night on Sorcerer\u0027s Isle, the powerful sorcerer Pug is awakened from a nightmare that portends destruction for all of Midkemia. Disturbed by the dream, Pug calls for a convening of the Conclave of Shadows. Though Pug does not yet know it, his son Magnus has discovered the cause of Pug\u0027s prophetic dream: a beacon has been unleashed, directing a vast army of alien invaders to Midkemia, an army so formidable that even the might of the Tsurani Empire might fall before its fury. Meanwhile, in far Stardock town, two boys are coming of age. But on the dusty path that leads them from home they are thrust by fate into a life undreamed of, becoming enmeshed in intrigue, murder, and treason. Though untrained and unready, they are called upon by the mysterious Conclave to travel deep into the heart of the Empire of Great Kesh, to confront a plot so dark and twisted it will implicate even the highest-ranking nobles of the Empire, even members of the royal family itself. And behind this plot they discover the ancient Brotherhood of Death, the clan of assassins known as the Nighthawks. And Pug will find himself once again facing his old nemesis, the evil wizard formerly known as Sidi, now Leso Varen, in a confrontation with everything at stake: his honor, his life, and the future of Midkemia.","isbn10":"0060792787","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Flight of the Nighthawks","ratings_count":"9378.0","authors":"Raymond E.

This edition of Oscar Wilde\u0027s classic work, The Picture of Dorian Gray, highlights the novel\u0027s modernity in both its form and its revolutionary content, and traces its links to modernist literature and the culture of modernity alike. Previous editions of the novel have only seen it in a late Victorian context, or as an extension of the aesthetic theories of Walter Pater and the \"art for art\u0027s sake\" movement. As presented in this new edition, however, the freshness and originality of the book emerges, along with its strong social messages. The book is a pastiche of genres that propels nineteenth-century realism into twentieth-century modernism ahead of its own time. Wilde\u0027s novel offers a myth for modernity whose hold on the cultural imagination has only strengthened over time-Dorian Gray\u0027s uncanny bond with his own portrait underscores the loss of selfhood everyone experiences in a world of images and copies, paves the way for the discourses of homosexuality and the understanding of lifestyle as identity so current today, and provides clues to the mysteries of modern ethics and politics. The edition also emphasizes the role of gender and the rise of female emancipation underlying the Sybil Vane subplot, a focus on women that intensifies the book\u0027s relevance to modern transformations of men and women alike.","isbn10":"0321427130","average_rating":"407.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Oscar Wilde\u0027s The Picture of Dorian Gray","ratings_count":"119.0","authors":"Oscar Wilde;Andrew Elfenbein"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":1.8370131254196167,"y":425.4204406738281,"id":"1807","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d_6flyQEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1997","isbn13":"9,78035E+12","num_pages":"384","description":"Beautiful Friday, a genetically engineered courier of the future, travels from New Zealand to Canada to beyond, as she engages in a series of daring and intriguing assignments.

The winner of a Hugo, a Nebula, and a World Fantasy Award, Vance lays claim to a career that spans more than five decades of critical acclaim and devoted readership. Tor Books has recognized his widespread audience and for years has brought classic Jack Vance novels back into print--most recently The Demon Princes, Volume One, and omnibus containing the first three books of Vance\u0027s beloved Demon Princes series. Tor now presents The Demon Princes, Volume Two, and omnibus containing the series\u0027 final two novels, The Face and The Book of Dreams. Kirth Gersen carries in his pocket a slip of paper with a list of five names written upon it--the names of five Demon Princes. The Demon Princes are a race of beings who disguise themselves as humans and delight in power and destruction. however, to Kirth they are merely murderers who killed his family and destroyed his home planet--and who deserves to die for those misdeeds. Three have already fallen in Kirth\u0027s hands, but there are two more names on his list, two more Princes who will live only long enough to regret their evil ways. Lens Larque was just as unique as the other Demon Princes--uniquely appalling. He was personally ugly, startling vicious, and arrogant above all others. Larque\u0027s own mission was a villainy of the highest order, and his personal obsession with success kept him hidden well from attackers--almost well enough. Howard Alan Treesong poisoned his friends, tortured his colleagues, and wrote his own horrific holy book, The Book of Dreams.

For the Centennial Edition two of the original translations have been replaced. In the original publication David Grene translated only one of the three Theban plays, Oedipus the King. Now he has added his own translations of the remaining two, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, thus bringing a new unity of tone and style to this group. Grene has also revised his earlier translation of Prometheus Bound and rendered some of the former prose sections in verse. These new translations replace the originals included in the paperback volumes Sophocles I (which contains all three Theban plays), Aeschylus II, Greek Tragedies, Volume I, and Greek Tragedies, Volume III, all of which are now being published in second editions. All other volumes contain the translations of the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides for the most part from the original versions first published in the 1940s and 1950s. These translations have been the choice of generations of teachers and students, selling in the past forty years over three million copies.","isbn10":"0226307654","average_rating":"414.0","categories":"Drama","title":"Greek tragedies","ratings_count":"33.0","authors":"Sophocles;Aeschylus;Euripides"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-245.44354248046875,"y":-37.17841720581055,"id":"772","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003doYAsTM2q0rEC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1977","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"1072","description":"Contains all of Blake\u0027s poetry with full annotation and a glossary of proper names.","isbn10":"0140422153","average_rating":"429.0","categories":"Literary Criticism","title":"The Complete Poems","ratings_count":"7584.0","authors":"William Blake"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":349.7283630371094,"y":174.5868682861328,"id":"762","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dBmE7b_S91roC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1986","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"160","description":"Mr. Willy Wonka might be a genius with chocolate, but Charlie and his family don\u0027t trust his flying skills one bit.

John \"Red\" Shea was a top lieutenant in the South Boston Irish mob, rising to this position at the age of twenty-one. Thus began his tutelage under the notorious Irish godfather James \"Whitey\" Bulger. An ice-cold enforcer with a legendary red-hot temper, Shea was a legend among his Southie peers in the 1980s. From the first delivery truck he robbed at thirteen to the start of his twelve-year federal sentence for drug trafficking at twenty-seven, Shea was a portrait in American crime -- a terror, brutal and ruthlessly ambitious. Drug dealer, loan shark, money launderer, and multimillion-dollar narcotics kingpin, Shea was at the pinnacle of power -- until the feds came knocking and eventually obliterated the legendary mob in a well-orchestrated sweep of arrests, fueled by insider tips to the FBI and DEA. While Bulger\u0027s other top men turned informant to save their own hides, Shea alone kept his code of honor and his mouth shut -- loyalty that earned him a dozen years of hard time even as the man he was protecting turned out to be, himself, a rat. For in the end, in a remarkable show of betrayal, Bulger turned out to be the FBI\u0027s \"main man\" and top informant -- tipping off the feds for decades while still managing to operate one of the most murderous and profitable organized crime outfits of all time. In Rat Bastards, Shea brings that mysterious world and gritty urban Irish American street culture into sharp focus by telling his own story -- of his fatherless upbringing, his apprenticeship on the tough streets of Southie, and his love affair with trouble, boxing, and then the gangster life. In prose that is refreshingly honest, personal, and surprisingly tender, Shea tells his harrowing, unflinching, and unapologetic story. A man who did the crime, did the time, and held fast to the Irish code of silence, which he was raised to follow at any cost, Shea remains a man of honor and in doing so has become a living legend. One of the last of a dying breed, a true stand-up guy. Shea expects no forgiveness and makes no excuses for the life he chose. His story is intense, compelling, and in your face.","isbn10":"0060837160","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Rat Bastards","ratings_count":"34.0","authors":"John Shea"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-290.38922119140625,"y":-106.15379333496094,"id":"1048","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dAp2kpWhee8cC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"344","description":"Presents a collection of inspirational poems by such authors as Emily Dickinson, Billy Collins, Robert Frost, and Raymond Carver.","isbn10":"0143037676","average_rating":"414.0","categories":"Poetry","title":"Good Poems for Hard Times","ratings_count":"2611.0","authors":"Garrison Keillor"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-288.3882751464844,"y":368.4469299316406,"id":"1217","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d9tysDhB2VMAC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1999","isbn13":"9,78019E+12","subtitle":"Apprendre l\u0027 anglais en lisant","num_pages":"560","description":"Follows the adventures of young Fabrizio del Dongo as he joins Napoleon\u0027s army just before the Battle of Waterloo, and struggles to keep hidden his love for Clelia amid the intrigues and secrets of the small court of Parma.","isbn10":"0192839578","average_rating":"382.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"La chartreuse de Parme","ratings_count":"51.0","authors":"Jm Stendhal"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-402.118408203125,"y":428.7433166503906,"id":"1355","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d6QOXQgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1996","isbn13":"9,78026E+12","num_pages":"657","description":"\"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade.

This Penguin Modern Classics edition is edited by Donald A. Yates and James E. Irby, with an introduction by James E. Irby and a preface by André Maurois. Jorge Luis Borges was a literary spellbinder whose tales of magic, mystery and murder are shot through with deep philosophical paradoxes. This collection brings together many of his stories, including the celebrated \u0027Library of Babel\u0027, whose infinite shelves contain every book that could ever exist, \u0027Funes the Memorious\u0027 the tale of a man fated never to forget a single detail of his life, and \u0027Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\u0027, in which a French poet makes it his life\u0027s work to create an identical copy of Don Quixote. In later life, dogged by increasing blindness, Borges used essays and brief tantalising parables to explore the enigma of time, identity and imagination. Playful and disturbing, scholarly and seductive, his is a haunting and utterly distinctive voice. Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Zizek inverts current pedagogicalstrategies to explain the difficult philosophical underpinnings of the French theoretician andpractician who revolutionized our view of psychoanalysis. He approaches Lacan through the motifs andworks of contemporary popular culture, from Hitchcock\u0027s Vertigo to Stephen King\u0027s Pet Sematary, fromMcCullough\u0027s An Indecent Obsession to Romero\u0027s Return of the Living Dead - a strategy of \"lookingawry\" that recalls the exhilarating and vital experience of Lacan.Zizek discovers fundamentalLacanian categories the triad Imaginary/Symbolic/Real, the object small a, the opposition of driveand desire, the split subject - at work in horror fiction, in detective thrillers, in romances, inthe mass media\u0027s perception of ecological crisis, and, above all, in Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s films. Theplayfulness of Zizek\u0027s text, however, is entirely different from that associated with thedeconstructive approach made famous by Derrida. By clarifying what Lacan is saying as well as whathe is not saying, Zizek is uniquely able to distinguish Lacan from the poststructuralists who sooften claim him.Slavoj Zizek is a Researcher in the Institute of Sociology at the University ofLjubljana, Yugoslavia.

In addition to reviewing recent interpretations of the individual traditions, he explores the interactions of the three religions and shows their continuing mutual influence to be subtle but unmistakable.

These subcultures, he maintains, are as important as the better-known orthodoxies to a full understanding of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.","isbn10":"0226204057","average_rating":"443.0","categories":"Religion","title":"History of Religious Ideas, Volume 3","ratings_count":"406.0","authors":"Mircea Eliade"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":275.2724914550781,"y":-164.11317443847656,"id":"375","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003doJ5dL5OmXHMC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","subtitle":"My Journey Through Twentieth-Century Philosophy","num_pages":"256","description":"Part memoir, part study, The Making of a Philosopher is the self–portrait of a deeply intelligent mind as it develops over a life on both sides of the Atlantic.

On the occasion of the Centennial of the University of Chicago and its Press, we take pleasure in reissuing this complete work in a handsome four-volume slipcased edition as well as in redesigned versions of the familiar paperbacks. For the Centennial Edition two of the original translations have been replaced. In the original publication David Grene translated only one of the three Theban plays, Oedipus the King. Now he has added his own translations of the remaining two, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, thus bringing a new unity of tone and style to this group. Grene has also revised his earlier translation of Prometheus Bound and rendered some of the former prose sections in verse. These new translations replace the originals included in the paperback volumes Sophocles I (which contains all three Theban plays), Aeschylus II, Greek Tragedies, Volume I, and Greek Tragedies, Volume III, all of which are now being published in second editions. All other volumes contain the translations of the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides for the most part from the original versions first published in the 1940s and 1950s.

Fury opens on a New York living at breakneck speed in an age of unprecedented decadence. Malik Solanka, historian of ideas and dollmaker extraordinaire, steps out of his life one day, abandons his family without a word of explanation, and flees to New York. There is a fury within him, and he fears that he has become dangerous to those he loves. He arrives in New York at a time of unprecedented plenty, in the highest hour of America\u0027s wealth and power, seeking to \"erase\" himself. But fury is all around him. Cab drivers spout invective. A serial killer is murdering women with a lump of concrete. The petty spats and bone-deep resentments of the metropolis engulf him. Meanwhile, his own thoughts, emotions and desires are also running wild. A young woman in a D\u0027Angelo baseball cap is in store.

This unbelievable autobiography explores the rebellious lives of four of the most influential icons in American rock history. Motley Crue was the voice of a barely pubescent Generation X, the anointed high priests of backward-masking pentagram rock, pioneers of Hollywood glam, and the creators of MTV\u0027s first \"power ballad.\" Their sex lives claimed celebrities from Heather Locklear to Pamela Anderson to Donna D\u0027Errico. Their scuffles involved everyone from Axl Rose to 2LiveCrew. Their hobbies have included collecting automatic weapons, cultivating long arrest records, pushing the envelope of conceivable drug abuse, and dreaming up backstage antics that would make Ozzy Osbourne blanch with modesty. Provocatively written and brilliantly designed, this book includes over 100 photos, many never before published, for the most exciting and insightful look ever into the Crue.","isbn10":"0060989157","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"The Dirt","ratings_count":"26377.0","authors":"Tommy Lee;Vince Neil;Nikki Sixx;Mick Mars"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":449.6600646972656,"y":404.9859924316406,"id":"1511","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dzqkdNwRxSooC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"A Desk Reference for the Curious Mind","num_pages":"1104","description":"Presents information on such subjects as art, architecture, biology, business, history, medicine, sports, philosophy, and film, with essays by experts on numerous topics, a biographical dictionary, and a writer\u0027s guide to grammar.","isbn10":"0312313675","average_rating":"409.0","categories":"Reference","title":"The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge","ratings_count":"150.0","authors":"The New York Times"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-465.6846618652344,"y":-495.6702880859375,"id":"1781","attributes":{"published_year":"1986","isbn13":"9,78035E+12","subtitle":"Pawn of Prophecy; Queen of Sorcery; Magician\u0027s Gambit; Castle of Wizardry; Enchanter\u0027s End Game","num_pages":"1635","isbn10":"0345340442","average_rating":"427.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Belgariad Boxed Set","ratings_count":"13225.0","authors":"David Eddings"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-232.53717041015625,"y":197.65992736816406,"id":"268","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dcC8-lwEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","subtitle":"Bags, Trips, Make-up Tips, Charity, Glory, and the Darker Side of the Story: Essays and Stories by Marian Keyes","num_pages":"368","description":"Go further under the covers and stay in bed a little longer with Marian Keyes in this winning follow-up to her smash essay collection, Under the Duvet.

As other perspectives on antitrust law have fallen away, Posner\u0027s book has played a major role in transforming the field of antitrust law into a body of economically rational principles largely in accord with the ideas set forth in the first edition. Today\u0027s antitrust professionals may disagree on specific practices and rules, but most litigators, prosecutors, judges, and scholars agree that the primary goal of antitrust laws should be to promote economic welfare, and that economic theory should be used to determine how well business practices conform to that goal. In this thoroughly revised edition, Posner explains the economic approach to new generations of lawyers and students. He updates and amplifies his approach as it applies to the developments, both legal and economic, in the antitrust field since 1976. The \"new economy,\" for example, has presented a host of difficult antitrust questions, and in an entirely new chapter, Posner explains how the economic approach can be applied to new industries such as software manufacturers, Internet service providers, and those that provide communications equipment and services. \"The antitrust laws are here to stay,\" Posner writes, \"and the practical question is how to administer them better-more rationally, more accurately, more expeditiously, more efficiently.\" This fully revised classic will continue to be the standard work in the field.","isbn10":"0226675769","average_rating":"4.0","categories":"Law","title":"Antitrust Law, Second Edition","ratings_count":"33.0","authors":"Richard A.

He was a writer of some distinction—a prolific novelist and a keen literary critic. He was also a dedicated anti-Semite, an acerbic opponent of French democracy, and editor in chief of the fascist weekly Je Suis Partout, in whose pages he regularly printed wartime denunciations of Jews and resistance activists. Was Brasillach in fact guilty of treason? Was he condemned for his denunciations of the resistance, or singled out as a suspected homosexual? Was it right that he was executed when others, who were directly responsible for the murder of thousands, were set free? Kaplan\u0027s meticulous reconstruction of Brasillach\u0027s life and trial skirts none of these ethical subtleties: a detective story, a cautionary tale, and a meditation on the disturbing workings of justice and memory, The Collaborator will stand as the definitive account of Brasillach\u0027s crime and punishment.

And he not only proves what he says, he tells others how to avoid a similar fate. Focusing on \"disruptive technology\" -- the Honda Super Cub, Intel\u0027s 8088 processor, or the hydraulic excavator, for example -- Christensen shows why most companies miss \"the next great wave.\" Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, The Innovator\u0027s Dilemma presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation. Find out: When it is right not to listen to customers. When to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins. When to pursue small markets at the expense of seemingly larger and more lucrative ones.

The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendía family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel García Márquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master. Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.","isbn10":"0060531045","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","ratings_count":"547207.0","authors":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":226.07864379882812,"y":-371.0470886230469,"id":"61","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dlXUSHqQfOD8C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78001E+12","num_pages":"207","description":"OWN BACK LIMITEDREVENGE ARRANGED, PRICE ACCORDING TO TASK, ALL DIFFICULT TASKS UNDERTAKEN, TREASURE HUNTED, ETC.

Reading the Bible Again for the First Time provides a much-needed solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet contemporary understanding of the scriptures. Many mistakenly believe there are no choices other than fundamentalism or simply rejecting the Bible as something that can bring meaning to our lives. Answering this modern dilemma, acclaimed author Marcus Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile the Bible with both a scientific and critical way of thinking and our deepest spiritual needs, leading to a contemporary yet grounded experience of the sacred texts. This seminal book shows you how to read the Bible as it should be examined—in an approach the author calls \"historical-metaphorical.\" Borg explores what the Scriptures meant to the ancient communities that produced and lived by them. He then helps us to discover the meaning of these stories, providing the knowledge and perspective to make the wisdom of the Bible an essential part of our modern lives. The author argues that the conventional way of seeing the Bible\u0027s origin, authority, and interpretation has become unpersuasive to millions of people in our time, and that we need a fresh way of encountering the Bible that takes the texts seriously but not literally, even as it takes seriously who we have become. Borg traces his personal spiritual journey, describing for readers how he moved from an unquestioning childhood belief in the biblical stories to a more powerful and dynamic relationship with the Bible as a sacred text brimming with meaning and guidance. Using his own experience as an example, he reveals how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in the misinterpretation of sacred texts as historical record and divine dictation, and opens readers to a truer, more abundant perspective. This unique book invites everyone—whatever one\u0027s religious background—to engage the Bible, wrestle with its meaning, explore its mysteries, and understand its relevance. Borg shows us how to encounter the Bible in a fresh way that rejects the limits of simple literalism and opens up rich possibilities for our lives.","isbn10":"0060609192","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Religion","title":"Reading the Bible Again for the First Time","ratings_count":"2875.0","authors":"Marcus J.

This Penguin Classics edition is translated from the Greek by J.A.K. Thomson with revisions and notes by Hugh Tredennick, and an introduction and bibliography by Jonathan Barnes. \u0027One swallow does not make a summer; neither does one day. Similarly neither can one day, or a brief space of time, make a man blessed and happy\u0027 In The Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle sets out to examine the nature of happiness. He argues that happiness consists in \u0027activity of the soul in accordance with virtue\u0027, for example with moral virtues, such as courage, generosity and justice, and intellectual virtues, such as knowledge, wisdom and insight. The Ethics also discusses the nature of practical reasoning, the value and the objects of pleasure, the different forms of friendship, and the relationship between individual virtue, society and the State. Aristotle\u0027s work has had a profound and lasting influence on all subsequent Western thought about ethical matters. Aristotle (384-22 BC) studied at the Academy of Plato for 20 years and then established his own school and research institute, \u0027The Lyceum\u0027. His writings, which were of extraordinary range, profoundly affected the whole course of ancient and medieval philosophy and are still eagerly studied and debated by philosophers today.

But then he becomes the guardian of a still more savage creature, a feral child who has grown up among deer.

Situating Jefferson within the context of America\u0027s evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years, Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it. Conflicted by power, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America\u0027s development, this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer, he was an awkward public speaker; a reluctant candidate, he left an indelible presidential legacy. Jefferson\u0027s statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France, doubling the size of the nation, and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition, opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jefferson\u0027s handling of the Barbary War, a lesser-known chapter of his political career, when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states, and the subsequent war with Tripoli, led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of America\u0027s reputation regarding national defense. In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama: the fledgling nation\u0027s struggle for independence, formed in the crucible of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and, in its shadow, the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution. This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in American history -- or in the ambiguities of human nature.","isbn10":"0060598964","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Thomas Jefferson","ratings_count":"2181.0","authors":"Christopher Hitchens"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-161.1278076171875,"y":-357.6719055175781,"id":"1143","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003de_y_H-HHNDgC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1986","isbn13":"9,78016E+12","subtitle":"From the Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin","num_pages":"304","description":"A year in the life (1931-1932) of writer Anais Nin when she met Henry Miller and his wife June.","isbn10":"015640057X","average_rating":"395.0","categories":"Authors, American","title":"Henry and June","ratings_count":"7535.0","authors":"Anaïs Nin"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-205.6741943359375,"y":-329.97552490234375,"id":"455","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dKPM0TYF7DNgC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2009","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","description":"Who will be the last unmarried man standing?

Even when he\u0027s stopped dead in his tracks by the most scandalous woman in all of London—Judith, Lady Chester—he vows to have her bedded but never wedded. Beautiful, and more than a little bit naughty, Judith has always kept herself within the bounds of respectability, even while playing by her own rules. And the experience has taught her to avoid marriage. She has no desire to resist Warton\u0027s hot kisses, and his tempting touch is impossible to ignore.

That\u0027s not a very promising beginning for a friendship, but Jess and Leslie Burke become inseparable. Together they create Terabithia, a magical kingdom in the woods where the two of them reign as king and queen, and their imaginations set the only limits. Then one morning a terrible tragedy occurs. Only when Jess is able to come to grips with this tragedy does he finally understand the strength and courage Leslie has given him.","isbn10":"0060734019","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"Bridge to Terabithia (rack)","ratings_count":"1764.0","authors":"Katherine Paterson"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":272.1203918457031,"y":326.1543884277344,"id":"231","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dQg8DO-EqFzoC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","subtitle":"The True Story of One Man\u0027s Miraculous Survival","num_pages":"218","description":"Joe Simpson and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, had just reached the top of a 21,000-foot peak in the Andes when disaster struck. Simpson plunged off the vertical face of an ice ledge, breaking his leg. In the hours that followed, darkness fell and a blizzard raged as Yates tried to lower his friend to safety. Finally, Yates was forced to cut the rope, moments before he would have been pulled to his own death. The next three days were an impossibly grueling ordeal for both men. Yates, certain that Simpson was dead, returned to base camp consumed with grief and guilt over abandoning him. Miraculously, Simpson had survived the fall, but crippled, starving, and severely frostbitten was trapped in a deep crevasse. Summoning vast reserves of physical and spiritual strength, Simpson crawled over the cliffs and canyons of the Andes, reaching base camp hours before Yates had planned to leave. How both men overcame the torments of those harrowing days is an epic tale of fear, suffering, and survival, and a poignant testament to unshakable courage and friendship.","isbn10":"0060730552","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Sports \u0026 Recreation","title":"Touching the Void","ratings_count":"42264.0","authors":"Joe Simpson"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":201.28652954101562,"y":-268.1479187011719,"id":"519","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dW9jVlwEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78007E+12","subtitle":"The Ends Justify the Meanness","num_pages":"176","description":"What Would Machiavelli Do?

The benefits said to be gained from going to school and keeping her temper elude her. The place of this enchanting, intensely moving story is Maycomb, Alabama. The time is the Depression, but Scout and her brother, Jem, are seldom depressed. They have appalling gifts for entertaining themselves—appalling, that is, to almost everyone except their wise lawyer father, Atticus. Atticus is a man of unfaltering good will and humor, and partly because of this, the children become involved in some disturbing adult mysteries: fascinating Boo Radley, who never leaves his house; the terrible temper of Mrs. Dubose down the street; the fine distinctions that make the Finch family \"quality\"; the forces that cause the people of Maycomb to show compassion in one crisis and unreasoning cruelty in another. Also because Atticus is what he is, and because he lives where he does, he and his children are plunged into a conflict that indelibly marks their lives—and gives Scout some basis for thinking she knows just about as much about the world as she needs to.","isbn10":"0061205699","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"To Kill a Mockingbird (slipcased edition)","ratings_count":"250.0","authors":"Harper Lee"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":490.8707580566406,"y":327.7552795410156,"id":"978","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dUqL39bMqZcoC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"A Novel of Lewis and Clark","num_pages":"432","description":"A fictionalized account based on the Lewis and Clark expedition to the Pacific Ocean seeks to convey what was happening in the minds of the explorers and to bring life to the collision of white and Native American cultures of the period.

Moelwyn Merchant with an introduction by Peter Holland. \u0027The quality of mercy is not strain\u0027d, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\u0027 Bassanio, a noble but impoverished Venetian, asks his friend the merchant Antonio for a loan to impress an heiress. Antonio agrees, but is forced to borrow the sum from a cynical Jewish moneylender, Shylock, who forces him into a chilling contract, which stipulates he must honour the debt with a pound of his own flesh. But Bassanio\u0027s beloved is not as demure as she seems, and disguising herself as a lawyer, Portia proves herself one of Shakespeare\u0027s most cunning heroines, in a witty attack on Shylock\u0027s claim. A complex and controversial comedy, The Merchant of Venice explores prejudice and the true nature of justice. This book contains a general introduction to Shakespeare\u0027s life and Elizabethan theatre, a separate introduction to The Merchant of Venice, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, an essay discussing performance options on both stage and screen, and a commentary. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was born to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden some time in late April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. He wrote about 38 plays (the precise number is uncertain), many of which are regarded as the most exceptional works of drama ever produced, including Romeo and Juliet (1595), Henry V (1599), Hamlet (1601), Othello (1604), King Lear (1606) and Macbeth (1606), as well as a collection of 154 sonnets, which number among the most profound and influential love-poetry in English.

It presents seventy substantial--and in some cases complete--selections from the best and most influential works in philosophy, offering a unique balance between classical and contemporary material. An extensive glossary of philosophical terms is also included. The fourth edition features fifteen new readings, including work by Albert Camus, Roderick M. Chisholm, Daniel Dennett, Harry G. Frankfurt, William Paley, Derek Parfit, John Perry, Richard Taylor, Peter Van Inwagen, Bernard Williams, and Susan Wolf. Part III, Knowledge and Reality, has been restructured and now includes Plato\u0027s Thaetetus, selections by Edmund L.

Originally published in 1994 -- and never before available in the United States -- Sleep, Pale Sister is a hypnotically atmospheric story set in nineteenth century London. When puritanical artist Henry Chester sees delicate child beauty Effie, he makes her his favorite model and, before long, his bride. But Henry, volatile and repressed, is in love with an ideal. Passive, docile, and asexual, the woman he projects onto Effie is far from the woman she really is. And when Effie begins to discover the murderous depths of Henry\u0027s hypocrisy, her latent passion will rise to the surface. Sleep, Pale Sister combines the ethereal beauty of a Pre-Raphaelite painting with a chilling high gothic tale and is a testament to Harris\u0027s brimming cornucopia of talents. This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.","isbn10":"0061843180","categories":"Fiction","title":"Sleep, Pale Sister","authors":"Joanne Harris"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-414.1383056640625,"y":15.293597221374512,"id":"535","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003duzPIf3Q981kC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78009E+12","num_pages":"232","description":"Despite the modern day emphasis on physical appearance, there is an easier way to become a desirable person rather than dieting or buying expensive clothes.

Frey urges writers to aim high-not to try to write a good-enough-to-get-published mystery, but a damn good mystery. A damn good mystery is first a dramatic novel, Frey insists-a dramatic novel with living, breathing characters-and he shows his readers how to create a living, breathing, believable character who will be clever and resourceful, willful and resolute, and will be what Frey calls \"the author of the plot behind the plot.\" Frey then shows, in his well-known, entertaining, and accessible (and often humorous) style , how the characters-the entire ensemble, including the murderer, the detective, the authorities, the victims, the suspects, the witnesses and the bystanders-create a complete and coherent world. Exploring both the on-stage action and the behind-the-scenes intrigue, Frey shows prospective writers how to build a fleshed-out, believable, and logical world. He shows them exactly which parts of that world show up in the pages of a damn good mystery-and which parts are held back just long enough to keep the reader guessing. This is an indispensable step-by-step guide for anyone who\u0027s ever dreamed of writing a damn good mystery.","isbn10":"0312304463","average_rating":"397.0","categories":"Language Arts \u0026 Disciplines","title":"How to Write a Damn Good Mystery","ratings_count":"305.0","authors":"James N.

As a result of his famous ”double pincer” maneuver, 70,000 Roman soldiers died within the space of a few hours on a field the size of New York\u0027s Central Park. Yet, as devastating and startling as Cannae was, it was only one of a long list of incredible achievements. Hannibal\u0027s fantastic 1,000-mile march across the Alps from Spain to Italy was one of the wonders of ancient times. He began his hazardous journey with 90,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, and 37 elephants. By the time he reached the Valley of the Po, more than 30,000 troops and many of his elephants had perished, but he still managed to stay in Italy for sixteen years.Blending biography and military adventure, Hannibal is a portrait of a military genius who was also a highly civilized man. The son of Hamilcar Barca, a famous general in his own right, Hannibal was a student of the Greek classics. But his father\u0027s lifelong grudge against Rome fostered in the son a deep hatred for that Republic and a fierce determination to subdue it forever. This resulted in the bloody battles of Lake Trasimene, Campania, Nole, Capua, and Zama, all of which Leonard Cottrell describes with vigor and authority. In gathering material for Hannibal, Cottrell traveled the entire route that Hannibal took across the Alps, thus bringing to his account a valuable firsthand knowledge of his subject. With the drama and authenticity for which he is famous, Leonard Cottrell describes Hannibal\u0027s amazing campaign—a saga of victory after victory which fell just short of its ultimate goal: the annihilation of Rome.","isbn10":"0306804980","average_rating":"389.0","categories":"History","title":"Hannibal","ratings_count":"128.0","authors":"Leonard Cottrell"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":349.3785095214844,"y":-74.95353698730469,"id":"678","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dVw1NGVkbEyAC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1991","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"With a New Introduction by the Author","num_pages":"480","description":"The scheme of two disgruntled CIA agents to stage an unsuccessful attempt on the life of President Kennedy and link it to Cuba backfires when the erratic Lee Harvey Oswald goes too far","isbn10":"0140156046","average_rating":"399.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"Libra","ratings_count":"11361.0","authors":"Don DeLillo"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":473.3934631347656,"y":-367.1932067871094,"id":"723","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003djt6DDwAAQBAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1996","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"A Memoir","num_pages":"448","description":"The author of Myra Breckenridge reminisces about his life, from his school days at St. Albans and Exeter to his rise as a literary superstar, and the famous people he has known, including the Kennedys, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and Eleanor Roosevelt.

Slavoj Zizek has been called \"an academic rock star\" and \"the wild man of theory\"; his writing mixes astonishing erudition and references to pop culture in order to dissect current intellectual pieties. In The Puppet and the Dwarf he offers a close reading of today\u0027s religious constellation from the viewpoint of Lacanian psychoanalysis. He critically confronts both predominant versions of today\u0027s spirituality--New Age gnosticism and deconstructionist-Levinasian Judaism--and then tries to redeem the \"materialist\" kernel of Christianity. His reading of Christianity is explicitly political, discerning in the Pauline community of believers the first version of a revolutionary collective. Since today even advocates of Enlightenment like Jurgen Habermas acknowledge that a religious vision is needed to ground our ethical and political stance in a \"postsecular\" age, this book--with a stance that is clearly materialist and at the same time indebted to the core of the Christian legacy--is certain to stir controversy.","isbn10":"0262740257","average_rating":"383.0","categories":"Philosophy","title":"The Puppet and the Dwarf","ratings_count":"617.0","authors":"Slavoj Žižek;Žižek;Stockholm Inst Of Transition Staff;Mladen Dolar;Alenka Zupancic"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-463.9137878417969,"y":378.3051452636719,"id":"115","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dSKYr4V6C1M0C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"32","description":"An adaptation of the original story follows the activities of seven children in nineteenth-century New England as they prepare for the Thanksgiving holiday while Mother is away caring for Grandmother.","isbn10":"0060004509","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"An Old-Fashioned Thanksgiving","ratings_count":"599.0","authors":"Louisa May Alcott;James Bernardin"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":369.0345764160156,"y":109.29219055175781,"id":"171","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003daWtIFc7kdzsC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1953","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"672","description":"Cross Damon, trapped within his own blackness, flees from Chicago\u0027s South Side to Harlem, where he joins the Communist Party.","isbn10":"0060539259","average_rating":"373.0","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Outsider","ratings_count":"1736.0","authors":"Richard Wright"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":186.79531860351562,"y":-113.03343200683594,"id":"756","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dFQjXMqlpfPEC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2001","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"272","description":"Bestselling author and radio storytelling sensation Stuart McLean revisits the heartwarming and hilarious friends from his iconic Vinyl Cafe.
