And he not only proves what he says, he tells others how to avoid a similar fate. Focusing on \"disruptive technology\" -- the Honda Super Cub, Intel\u0027s 8088 processor, or the hydraulic excavator, for example -- Christensen shows why most companies miss \"the next great wave.\" Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, The Innovator\u0027s Dilemma presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation. Find out: When it is right not to listen to customers. When to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins. When to pursue small markets at the expense of seemingly larger and more lucrative ones.

ARROW IN THE BLUE ended with his joining the Communist Party and THE INVISIBLE WRITING covers some of the most important experiences in his life. We see him in Germany, Russia, England, France and Spain, working sometimes openly and sometimes underground for the cause in which he believed. This was the time of the \u0027seven years\u0027 night\u0027 over Europe - of Hitler\u0027s spectacular successes against the Western Democracies. They were also the years of the great Russian purges, which led to Koestler#s eventual break with Communism in 1938, after Hitler and Stalin between them had claimed the lives of most of his friends and relatives. This book tells of Koestler\u0027s travels through Russia and remote parts of Soviet Central Asia and of his life as an exile. It puts in perspective his experiences in Franco\u0027s prisons under sentence of death and in concentration camps in Occupied France (told at greater length in DIALOGUE WITH DEATH AND SCUM OF THE EARTH), and ends with his escape from Occupied France in 1940 to England, where he found stability and a new home. An epilogue brings the story up to 1953, when it was written. Koestler calls the book \u0027a typical case history of a member of the educated middle classes of Central Europe in our time\u0027. It has two main themes: the historical background against which the author developed, and an unsparing analysis of his intellectual and spiritual development.","isbn10":"0099490684","average_rating":"435","categories":"Authors, English","title":"The Invisible Writing","ratings_count":"111","authors":"Arthur Koestler"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":182.42733764648438,"y":187.4647216796875,"id":"637","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dWPjQPAAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78013E+12","subtitle":"The Writing of Fiction/Literary Nonfiction, Poetry, and Drama","num_pages":"476","description":"Three Genres gives students a basic introduction to fiction/ literary nonfiction, poetry, and drama and helps them to develop their creative skills in each area.

But not completely forgotten. Professor Savant believed in the Whangdoodle.

John \"Red\" Shea was a top lieutenant in the South Boston Irish mob, rising to this position at the age of twenty-one. Thus began his tutelage under the notorious Irish godfather James \"Whitey\" Bulger. An ice-cold enforcer with a legendary red-hot temper, Shea was a legend among his Southie peers in the 1980s. From the first delivery truck he robbed at thirteen to the start of his twelve-year federal sentence for drug trafficking at twenty-seven, Shea was a portrait in American crime -- a terror, brutal and ruthlessly ambitious. Drug dealer, loan shark, money launderer, and multimillion-dollar narcotics kingpin, Shea was at the pinnacle of power -- until the feds came knocking and eventually obliterated the legendary mob in a well-orchestrated sweep of arrests, fueled by insider tips to the FBI and DEA. While Bulger\u0027s other top men turned informant to save their own hides, Shea alone kept his code of honor and his mouth shut -- loyalty that earned him a dozen years of hard time even as the man he was protecting turned out to be, himself, a rat. For in the end, in a remarkable show of betrayal, Bulger turned out to be the FBI\u0027s \"main man\" and top informant -- tipping off the feds for decades while still managing to operate one of the most murderous and profitable organized crime outfits of all time. In Rat Bastards, Shea brings that mysterious world and gritty urban Irish American street culture into sharp focus by telling his own story -- of his fatherless upbringing, his apprenticeship on the tough streets of Southie, and his love affair with trouble, boxing, and then the gangster life. In prose that is refreshingly honest, personal, and surprisingly tender, Shea tells his harrowing, unflinching, and unapologetic story. A man who did the crime, did the time, and held fast to the Irish code of silence, which he was raised to follow at any cost, Shea remains a man of honor and in doing so has become a living legend. One of the last of a dying breed, a true stand-up guy. Shea expects no forgiveness and makes no excuses for the life he chose. His story is intense, compelling, and in your face.","isbn10":"0060837160","average_rating":"373","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Rat Bastards","ratings_count":"34","authors":"John Shea"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":371.2684020996094,"y":335.21148681640625,"id":"556","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dvd1pffZFhZ8C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2000","isbn13":"9,7801E+12","num_pages":"255","description":"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, an evil legacy long believed dead is stirring.

What is the biological basis behind some heavy drinkers\u0027 belief that the \"hair-of-the-dog\" method alleviates the effects of a hangover? Why does marijuana seem to affect ones problem-solving capacity? Intoxicating Minds is, in the author\u0027s words, \"a grand excavation of drug myth.\" Neither extolling nor condemning drug use, it is a story of scientific and artistic achievement, war and greed, empires and religions, and lessons for the future. Ciaran Regan looks at each class of drugs, describing the historical evolution of their use, explaining how they work within the brain\u0027s neurophysiology, and outlining the basic pharmacology of those substances. From a consideration of the effect of stimulants, such as caffeine and nicotine, and the reasons and consequences of their sudden popularity in the seventeenth century, the book moves to a discussion of more modern stimulants, such as cocaine and ecstasy. In addition, Regan explains how we process memory, the nature of thought disorders, and therapies for treating depression and schizophrenia. Regan then considers psychedelic drugs and their perceived mystical properties and traces the history of placebos to ancient civilizations. Finally, Intoxicating Minds considers the physical consequences of our co-evolution with drugs -- how they have altered our very being -- and offers a glimpse of the brave new world of drug therapies.","isbn10":"0231118953","average_rating":"376","categories":"Philosophy","title":"Antigone\u0027s Claim","ratings_count":"406","authors":"Judith Butler"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-461.9867248535156,"y":-291.32049560546875,"id":"504","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dH-igY69LTxcC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1995","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"32","description":"Laura helps Ma and Pa make the little log cabin snug and cozy for the snowy days ahead. 1994 \"Pick of the Lists\" (ABA)","isbn10":"0064433730","average_rating":"428","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"Winter Days in the Big Woods","ratings_count":"1487","authors":"Laura Ingalls Wilder"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-251.46847534179688,"y":507.52984619140625,"id":"532","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d0U8CAAAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1964","isbn13":"9,78008E+12","num_pages":"773","description":"Translated by Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb, Edited, with an Introduction, Moses Hadas","isbn10":"0075536390","average_rating":"429","categories":"History","title":"The Complete Works","ratings_count":"267","authors":"Tacitus"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-454.6896057128906,"y":475.3175048828125,"id":"1257","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dgHxbbwhmFhcC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,7802E+12","num_pages":"160","description":"Depicts the humorous mishaps which follow when young Claudio is duped into believing his fiancee has been unfaithful.","isbn10":"0198321473","average_rating":"406","categories":"Juvenile Nonfiction","title":"Much Ado about Nothing","ratings_count":"37","authors":"William Shakespeare"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":238.18209838867188,"y":-434.6905517578125,"id":"639","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d5xz3PgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2007","isbn13":"9,78013E+12","num_pages":"633","description":"Suitable for introductory Social Psychology classes, this work presents a scientific approach to social psychology.","isbn10":"0132382458","average_rating":"398","categories":"Psychology","title":"Social Psychology","ratings_count":"38","authors":"Elliot Aronson;Timothy D.

Now, with The Crusader, Kengor returns with the one book about Reagan that has not been written: The story of his lifelong crusade against communism, and of his dogged–and ultimately triumphant–effort to overthrow the Soviet Union. Drawing upon reams of newly declassified presidential papers, as well as untapped Soviet media archives and new interviews with key players, Kengor traces Reagan\u0027s efforts to target the Soviet Union from his days as governor of California to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of what he famously dubbed the \"Evil Empire.\" The result is a major revision and enhancement of what historians are only beginning to realize: That Reagan not only wished for the collapse of communism, but had a deep and specific understanding of what it would take––and effected dozens of policy shifts that brought the USSR to its heels within a decade of his presidency. The Crusader makes use of key sources from behind the Iron Curtain, including one key memo that implicates a major American liberal politician–still in office today–in a scheme to enlist Soviet premier Yuri Andropov to help defeat Reagan\u0027s 1984 reelection bid. Such new finds make The Crusader not just a work of extraordinary history, but a work of explosive revelation that will be debated as hotly in 2006 as Reagan\u0027s policies were in the 1980s.","isbn10":"0061136905","average_rating":"373","categories":"Political Science","title":"The Crusader","ratings_count":"132","authors":"Paul Kengor"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-97.86651611328125,"y":238.43896484375,"id":"1792","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dd1aq550uCbQC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1996","isbn13":"9,78035E+12","subtitle":"The Road to Madness","num_pages":"379","description":"A collection of horror tales spanning the author\u0027s career includes \"The Street,\" \"The Lurking Fear,\" \"Dagon,\" \"The Evil Clergyman,\" and \"Cool Air\"","isbn10":"0345384229","average_rating":"43","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Transition of H.P.

In The Crossing, sixteen-year-old Billy Parham captures a wolf that has been marauding his family’s ranch and, instead of killing it, decides to take it on a perilous journey home to the mountains of Mexico.These two drifters come together years later in Cities of the Plain, a magnificent tale of friendship and passion.

O these fashionable people!\u0027 Frances Burney\u0027s first and most enduringly popular novel is a vivid, satirical, and seductive account of the pleasures and dangers of fashionable life in late eighteenth-century London. As she describes her heroine\u0027s entry into society, womanhood and, inevitably, love, Burney exposes the vulnerability of female innocence in an image-conscious and often cruel world where social snobbery and sexual aggression are played out in the public arenas of pleasure-gardens, theatre visits, and balls. But Evelina\u0027s innocence also makes her a shrewd commentator on the excesses and absurdities of manners and social ambitions - as well as attracting the attention of the eminently eligible Lord Orville. Evelina, comic and shrewd, is at once a guide to fashionable London, a satirical attack on the new consumerism, an investigation of women\u0027s position in the late eighteenth century, and a love story. The new introduction and full notes to this edition help make this richness all the more readily available to a modern reader.","isbn10":"0192840312","average_rating":"366","categories":"Fiction","title":"Evelina, Or, The History of a Young Lady\u0027s Entrance Into the World","ratings_count":"11701","authors":"Fanny Burney"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-252.162353515625,"y":96.21435546875,"id":"659","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d5gpxxgEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1972","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"A Book","num_pages":"176","description":"Examines the social implications and psychological impact of the images and conventions of modern and classical artists","isbn10":"0140135154","average_rating":"378","categories":"Art","title":"Ways of Seeing","ratings_count":"177890","authors":"John Berger;Sven Blomberg;Chris Fox;Michael Dibb;Richard Hollis"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-312.5928039550781,"y":413.10321044921875,"id":"521","attributes":{"published_year":"1980","isbn13":"9,78007E+12","num_pages":"210","description":"The Blessed Virgin\u0027s deliverance of a prophecy to a peasant girl in Fatima in 1914 is followed years later by signs and omens including worldwide droughts and famines that signify its imminent fulfillment","isbn10":"0070488207","average_rating":"386","categories":"Fiction","title":"Virgin","ratings_count":"300","authors":"James Patterson"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-52.909603118896484,"y":-84.62063598632812,"id":"1223","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dF-oRDAAAQBAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78019E+12","num_pages":"144","description":"This is a book about the invention of Western philosophy, and the first thinkers to explore ideas about the nature of reality, time, and the origin of the universe.

Generations of philosophers, both ancient and modern, have traced their inspiration back to the presocratics, even though we have very few of their writings left. In this book, Catherine Osborne invites her readers to dip their toes into the fragmentary remains of thinkers from Thales to Pythagoras, Heraclitus to Protagoras, to try to fill in the bits of a jigsaw that has been rejigged many times and in many different ways.

John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It’s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames’s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family’s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather’s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend’s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames’s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life’s details, Gilead is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.","isbn10":"0002005883","average_rating":"385","categories":"Fiction","title":"Gilead","ratings_count":"361","authors":"Marilynne Robinson"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":67.38882446289062,"y":110.56475830078125,"id":"391","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d2GESvfIWs4YC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1998","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"321","description":"A debut novel of dark foreboding and family tragedy that won the prestigious Booker Prize traces the decline of one family in Southern India in the late sixties, which begins with an episode of forbidden love.

This volume, with its erudite introduction by Mario Praz, presents three of the most celebrated Gothic novels: The Castle of Otranto, published pseudonymously in 1765, is one of the first of the genre and the most truly Gothic of the three. Vathek (1786), an oriental tale by an eccentric millionaire, exotically combines Gothic romanticism with the vivacity of The Arabian Nights and is a narrative tour de force. The story of Frankenstein (1818) and the monster he created is as spine-chilling today as it ever was; as in all Gothic novels, horror is the keynote.

The esay which follows the translation provides new insights into this puzzling thirteenth-century work. Musa regards Dante\u0027s intention in this so-called \"Book of Memory\" as a cruel and comic commentary on the youthful lover. He argues that Dante, using the tradition of love poetry current in his time, points up the foolishness and shallowness of his protagonist, a self-centered and self-pitying youth who only occasionally in the progress of his suffering catches even a glimpse of the true nature of Love or his beloved. \"The sensitive man who would realize a man\u0027s destiny must ruthlessly cut out of his heart the canker at its center [i.e. self-pity], the canker that the heart instinctively tends to cultivate.\" According to Musa, this is one of Dante\u0027s central ideas.

In this wise and practical book, the Dalai Lama shows us how to place our working lives into the context of our lives as a whole. Rather than striving to find a role which suits us, we should allow our work to arise naturally from who we are - and what is most important to us. From here we reach a pathway that can lead us to true life fulfilment and purpose.","isbn10":"0340831200","average_rating":"416","categories":"Buddhism","title":"The Art of Happiness at Work","ratings_count":"1583","authors":"Dalai Lama XIV Bstan-ʼdzin-rgya-mtsho;Howard C.

He was also a dedicated anti-Semite, an acerbic opponent of French democracy, and editor in chief of the fascist weekly Je Suis Partout, in whose pages he regularly printed wartime denunciations of Jews and resistance activists. Was Brasillach in fact guilty of treason? Was he condemned for his denunciations of the resistance, or singled out as a suspected homosexual? Was it right that he was executed when others, who were directly responsible for the murder of thousands, were set free? Kaplan\u0027s meticulous reconstruction of Brasillach\u0027s life and trial skirts none of these ethical subtleties: a detective story, a cautionary tale, and a meditation on the disturbing workings of justice and memory, The Collaborator will stand as the definitive account of Brasillach\u0027s crime and punishment.

Arguably the most significant scientific discovery of the new century, the mapping of the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes that make up the human genome raises almost as many questions as it answers. Questions that will profoundly impact the way we think about disease, about longevity, and about free will. Questions that will affect the rest of your life. Genome offers extraordinary insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough. By picking one newly discovered gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine. From Huntington\u0027s disease to cancer, from the applications of gene therapy to the horrors of eugenics, Matt Ridley probes the scientific, philosophical, and moral issues arising as a result of the mapping of the genome.

Stunning new photographs by Nick Kelsh beautifully complement Carson\u0027s intimate account of adventures with her young nephew, Roger, as they enjoy walks along the rocky coast of Maine and through dense forests and open fields, observing wildlife, strange plants, moonlight and storm clouds, and listening to the \"living music\" of insects in the underbrush. \"If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder.\" Writes Carson, \"he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in.\" The Sense of Wonder is a refreshing antidote to indifference and a guide to capturing the simple power of discovery that Carson views as essential to life. In her insightful new introduction, Linda Lear remembers Rachel Carson\u0027s groundbreaking achievements in the context of the legendary environmentalist\u0027s personal commitment to introducing young and old to the miracles of nature. Kelsh\u0027s lush photographs inspire sensual, tactile reactions: masses of leaves floating in a puddle are just waiting to be scooped up and examined more closely. An image of a narrow path through the trees evokes the earthy scent of the woods after a summer rain. Close-ups of mosses and miniature lichen fantasy-lands will spark innocent\u0027as well as more jaded\u0027imaginations.

At their head was Thomas Clarkson, a divinity student who travelled 35,000 miles on horseback documenting abuses, talking to supporters, and evading attempts on his life.

This Penguin Modern Classics edition is edited by Donald A. Yates and James E. Irby, with an introduction by James E. Irby and a preface by André Maurois. Jorge Luis Borges was a literary spellbinder whose tales of magic, mystery and murder are shot through with deep philosophical paradoxes. This collection brings together many of his stories, including the celebrated \u0027Library of Babel\u0027, whose infinite shelves contain every book that could ever exist, \u0027Funes the Memorious\u0027 the tale of a man fated never to forget a single detail of his life, and \u0027Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\u0027, in which a French poet makes it his life\u0027s work to create an identical copy of Don Quixote. In later life, dogged by increasing blindness, Borges used essays and brief tantalising parables to explore the enigma of time, identity and imagination. Playful and disturbing, scholarly and seductive, his is a haunting and utterly distinctive voice. Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. A poet, critic and short story writer, he received numerous awards for his work including the 1961 International Publisher\u0027s Prize (shared with Samuel Beckett). He has a reasonable claim, along with Kafka and Joyce, to be one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century.

The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture.

The effects of the immense waves were felt as far away as France. Barometers in Bogotá and Washington, D.C., went haywire. Bodies were washed up in Zanzibar. The sound of the island\u0027s destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away. Most significant of all -- in view of today\u0027s new political climate -- the eruption helped to trigger in Java a wave of murderous anti-Western militancy among fundamentalist Muslims, one of the first outbreaks of Islamic-inspired killings anywhere. Krakatoa gives us an entirely new perspective on this fascinating and iconic event.

Sue Monk was a \"conventionally religious, churchgoing woman, a traditional wife and mother\" with a thriving career as a Christian writer until she began to question her role as a woman in her culture, her family, and her church. From a jarring encounter with sexism in a suburban drugstore to monastery retreats and rituals in the caves of Crete, Kidd takes readers through the fear, anger, healing, and transformation of her awakening. Retaining a meaningful connection \"with the deep song of Christianity,\" she opens the door for traditional Christian women to discover a spirituality that speaks directly to them and provides inspiring wisdom for all who struggle to embrace their full humanity.","isbn10":"006064589X","average_rating":"373","categories":"Religion","title":"The Dance of the Dissident Daughter","ratings_count":"5319","authors":"Sue Monk Kidd"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-39.88149642944336,"y":-15.952210426330566,"id":"1055","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d8SayNAEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"Why the West\u0027s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good","num_pages":"436","description":"Argues that western foreign aid efforts have done little to stem global poverty, citing how such organizations as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are not held accountable for ineffective practices that the author believes intrude into the inner workings of other countries.

Said\u0027s Orientalism has defined our understanding of colonialism and empire, and this Penguin Modern Classics edition contains a preface written by Said shortly before his death in 2003. In this highly-acclaimed work, Edward Said surveys the history and nature of Western attitudes towards the East, considering orientalism as a powerful European ideological creation - a way for writers, philosophers and colonial administrators to deal with the \u0027otherness\u0027 of eastern culture, customs and beliefs. He traces this view through the writings of Homer, Nerval and Flaubert, Disraeli and Kipling, whose imaginative depictions have greatly contributed to the West\u0027s romantic and exotic picture of the Orient. Drawing on his own experiences as an Arab Palestinian living in the West, Said examines how these ideas can be a reflection of European imperialism and racism. Edward W. Said (1935-2003) was a Palestinian-American cultural critic and author, born in Jerusalem and educated in Egypt and the United States. His other books include The Question of Palestine, Culture and Imperialism and Out of Place: A Memoir.

For the Centennial Edition two of the original translations have been replaced. In the original publication David Grene translated only one of the three Theban plays, Oedipus the King. Now he has added his own translations of the remaining two, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, thus bringing a new unity of tone and style to this group. Grene has also revised his earlier translation of Prometheus Bound and rendered some of the former prose sections in verse. These new translations replace the originals included in the paperback volumes Sophocles I (which contains all three Theban plays), Aeschylus II, Greek Tragedies, Volume I, and Greek Tragedies, Volume III, all of which are now being published in second editions. All other volumes contain the translations of the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides for the most part from the original versions first published in the 1940s and 1950s.

Together with the shorter recollections of James Edward\u0027s two sisters, Anna Lefroy and Caroline Austen, the Memoir remains the prime authority for her life and continues to inform all subsequent accounts. These are family memories, the record of Jane Austen\u0027s life shaped and limited by the loyalties, reserve, and affection of nieces and nephews recovering in old age the outlines of the young aunt they had each known. They still remembered the shape of her bonnet and the tone of her voice, and their first-hand accounts bring her vividly before us. Their declared partiality also raises fascinating issues concerning biographical truth, and the terms in which all biography functions. This edition brings together for the first time these three memoirs, and also includes Jane\u0027s brother Henry Austen\u0027s \u0027Biographical Notice\u0027 of 1818 and his lesser known \u0027Memoir\u0027 of 1833, making a unique biographical record. -","isbn10":"0192840746","average_rating":"383","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"A Memoir of Jane Austen","ratings_count":"880","authors":"James Edward Austen-Leigh"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":195.98886108398438,"y":-61.726287841796875,"id":"1649","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dCf8UfBNXdQ0C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78032E+12","num_pages":"288","description":"The Norwegian journalist provides a portrait of a committed Muslim man and his family living in post-Taliban Kabul, Afghanistan.","isbn10":"0316159417","average_rating":"377","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"The Bookseller of Kabul","ratings_count":"33499","authors":"Asne Seierstad"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-266.70709228515625,"y":32.52996826171875,"id":"1674","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dQkhpvgEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1997","isbn13":"9,78032E+12","subtitle":"Essays and Arguments Tag - Author of Infinite Jest","num_pages":"353","description":"In this exuberantly praised book - a collection of seven pieces on subjects ranging from television to tennis, from the Illinois State Fair to the films of David Lynch, from postmodern literary theory to the supposed fun of traveling aboard a Caribbean luxury cruiseliner - David Foster Wallace brings to nonfiction the same curiosity, hilarity, and exhilarating verbal facility that has delighted readers of his fiction, including the bestselling Infinite Jest.","isbn10":"0316919896","average_rating":"427","categories":"Humor","title":"A Supposedly Fun Thing I\u0027ll Never Do Again","ratings_count":"702","authors":"David Foster Wallace"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-477.30108642578125,"y":-40.90924072265625,"id":"1360","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d17YrneuxiTgC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1997","isbn13":"9,78026E+12","num_pages":"221","description":"\"Pop internationalists\"--people who speak impressively about international trade while ignoring basic economics and misusing economic figures are the target of this collection of Paul Krugman\u0027s most recent essays.

The next three essays expose further distortions of economic theory and include the complete, unaltered, controversial review of Laura Tyson\u0027s Who\u0027s Bashing Whom.

A two-time Tony winner, she married and later divorced her second love, Jason Robards, and never lost sight of the strength that made her a star. Now, thirty years after the publication of her original National Book Award–winning memoir, Bacall has added new material to her inspiring history.

I was too scared to even look at my father. I didn\u0027t want to see the disappointment and horror on his face. All that hate I had accumulated for him over the years, all the resentment against him for not understanding what I was going through, just released with the tears. \"So, where are your parents?\" the stewardess asked me after a few minutes. \"I can\u0027t wait here with you much longer.\" I looked up and wiped my eyes. My father was standing ten feet away. He didn\u0027t even recognize me. In the underbelly of Las Vegas, a cesspool of warring biker gangs and seedy strip clubs transformed the gawky, brace-faced Jenna Massoli into the bombshell Jenna Jameson. Today, Jenna Jameson is the biggest star in the history of adult movies, consistently ranked as one of the most beautiful women alive. But behind the glamour and the meteoric rise to fame was a path paved with tragedy and heartbreak. As a teenager drawn into a chaotic world ruled by rape, abuse, and murder, Jenna plunged into a downward spiral of addiction, even as she became one of the most photographed women in adult magazines. Determined to overcome this past, Jenna rebounded in the adult-film business, where she encountered sadistic directors, experienced lovers of both sexes, amorous celebrities (from Howard Stern to Marilyn Manson to Tommy Lee), bitter rival starlets, and finally, glory, as she went on to become the biggest porn star the world has ever seen. But her struggle for happiness did not end when the accolades began. For years she wrestled with her resentment at her estranged father, the loneliness of growing up from the age of two without a mother, and her enduring childhood desire to find a man who could give her the security and love she never had. Her unforgettable memoir is many things at once: a shocking sexual history, an insider\u0027s guide to the secret workings of the billion-dollar adult-film industry, and a gripping thriller that probes deep into Jenna\u0027s dark past. An unparalleled exploration of sexual freedom, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star ventures far beyond the flesh, into the heart-shredding tragedies and adrenaline-pumping triumphs of a woman who has already lived a hundred lifetimes. Always witty and humorous even as she faces the demons of her past, Jenna offers hilarious anecdotes about one of the most controversial businesses in history, and shares outrageous advice, including her ten commandments of dating and sex, how to become a \"suitcase pimp,\" and how to make it in the business as a female (or a male). Add to this never-before-seen photographs from Jenna\u0027s private collection and others taken exclusively for this book, and the result is certain to be one of the most talked-about books of the year.","isbn10":"0060539097","average_rating":"373","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star","ratings_count":"10211","authors":"Jenna Jameson;Neil Strauss"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-38.201900482177734,"y":-87.44314575195312,"id":"1047","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dL-xBPgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"1017","description":"The English equity court of the nineteenth-century is satirized in Dickins\u0027 tale about the suit of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce.","isbn10":"0143037617","average_rating":"401","categories":"Fiction","title":"Bleak House","ratings_count":"77515","authors":"Charles Dickens;Nicola Bradbury"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":306.0892028808594,"y":-365.6674499511719,"id":"1373","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dYj1EPgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78029E+12","subtitle":"The Biography of a Dangerous Idea","num_pages":"248","description":"A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOKThe Babylonians invented it, the Greeks banned it, the Hindus worshipped it, and the Christian Church used it to fend off heretics.

When Cecily Deravenel tells her eighteen-year-old son Edward of the death of his father, brother, uncle, and cousin in a fire, a part of him dies as well. Edward and his cousin Neville Watkins are suspicious of the deaths. They vow to seek the truth, avenge the deaths, and retake control of their family\u0027s business empire. As he grows into a handsome, charismatic man, Edward is torn between duty and desire. There are women in his life for whom he\u0027ll risk everything--and one woman who might destroy him. But madness and secrecy lie at the heart of the family, and Edward\u0027s enemies are far more ruthless than he knows. He will need his strength more than ever when the house of Deravenel is fatally rocked by betrayal from within. Who will become the ultimate ruler of the Deravenels? Power and money, passion and adultery, ambition and treachery all illuminate a dramatic epic saga that brings to life the glittering Edwardian Era.

But he also inspires the respect that comes from an illustrious career, and, among many who were his colleagues and peers, he inspired friendship. The Work of Mourning is a collection that honors those friendships in the wake of passing. Gathered here are texts—letters of condolence, memorial essays, eulogies, funeral orations—written after the deaths of well-known figures: Roland Barthes, Paul de Man, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Edmond Jabès, Louis Marin, Sarah Kofman, Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-François Lyotard, Max Loreau, Jean-Marie Benoist, Joseph Riddel, and Michel Servière. With his words, Derrida bears witness to the singularity of a friendship and to the absolute uniqueness of each relationship. In each case, he is acutely aware of the questions of tact, taste, and ethical responsibility involved in speaking of the dead—the risks of using the occasion for one\u0027s own purposes, political calculation, personal vendetta, and the expiation of guilt. More than a collection of memorial addresses, this volume sheds light not only on Derrida\u0027s relation to some of the most prominent French thinkers of the past quarter century but also on some of the most important themes of Derrida\u0027s entire oeuvre-mourning, the \"gift of death,\" time, memory, and friendship itself. \"In his rapt attention to his subjects\u0027 work and their influence upon him, the book also offers a hesitant and tangential retelling of Derrida\u0027s own life in French philosophical history. There are illuminating and playful anecdotes—how Lyotard led Derrida to begin using a word-processor; how Paul de Man talked knowledgeably of jazz with Derrida\u0027s son. Anyone who still thinks that Derrida is a facetious punster will find such resentful prejudice unable to survive a reading of this beautiful work.\"—Steven Poole, Guardian \"Strikingly simpa meditations on friendship, on shared vocations and avocations and on philosophy and history.\"—Publishers Weekly","isbn10":"0226142817","average_rating":"422","categories":"Literary Criticism","title":"The Work of Mourning","ratings_count":"163","authors":"Jacques Derrida"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":344.7345886230469,"y":-301.3621826171875,"id":"471","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003deev4uAEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1991","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","subtitle":"The Age of the Fable, The Age of Chivalry, Legends of","num_pages":"768","description":"A beautiful gift edition of Thomas Bulfinch\u0027s classic retelling of famous myths and folk legends, with interpretive essays by Princeton classics professor Richard P.

This Penguin Shakespeare edition is edited by Peter Davison with an introduction by Adrian Poole. Angered by the loss of his son in battle, the Earl of Northumberland supports another rebellion against King Henry IV, bringing the country to the brink of civil war. Sick and weary, the old King sends out his forces, including the unruly Sir John Falstaff, to meet the rebels. But as the conflict grows, he must also confront a more personal problem - how to make his reprobate son Prince Hal aware of the duties he must bear, as heir to the throne. This book contains a general introduction to Shakespeare\u0027s life and Elizabethan theatre, a separate introduction to Henry IV Part II, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, an essay discussing performance options on both stage and screen, and a commentary. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was born to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden some time in late April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. He wrote about 38 plays (the precise number is uncertain), many of which are regarded as the most exceptional works of drama ever produced, including Romeo and Juliet (1595), Henry V (1599), Hamlet (1601), Othello (1604), King Lear (1606) and Macbeth (1606), as well as a collection of 154 sonnets, which number among the most profound and influential love-poetry in English.

Emma Donoghue\u0027s introduction deftly guides readers into the rich tradition of women\u0027s poetry in English, exploring the relationships between poets and their muses and poets and their cultures.

Insisting on the centrality of women as historical actors and gender as a category of analysis, this work shows how the fateful political choices made by the low-country yeomanry were rooted in the politics of the household, particularly in the customary relations of power male heads of independent households assumed over their dependents, whether slaves or free women and children. Such masterly prerogatives, practiced in the domestic sphere and redeemed in the public, explain the yeomanry\u0027s deep commitment to slavery and, ultimately, their ardent embrace of secession.By placing the yeomanry in the center of the drama, McCurry offers a significant reinterpretation of this volatile society on the road to Civil War. Through careful and creative use of a wide variety of archival sources, she brings vividly to life the small worlds of yeoman households, and the larger world of the South Carolina Low Country, the plantation South, and nineteenth-century America.","isbn10":"0195117956","average_rating":"371","categories":"History","title":"Masters of Small Worlds","ratings_count":"96","authors":"Stephanie McCurry"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":120.85989379882812,"y":-113.91275024414062,"id":"173","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dk6LVNLM_D-8C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"327","description":"A team of scientists struggles to define and contain a deadly bacteria brought back from outer space by a satellite.","isbn10":"0060541814","average_rating":"373","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Andromeda Strain","ratings_count":"192637","authors":"Michael Crichton"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":329.1597595214844,"y":-192.7938232421875,"id":"1328","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dq-a-AQAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78023E+12","subtitle":"Intimate and Unseen Photographs of the Kennedys","num_pages":"432","isbn10":"0233000119","average_rating":"434","categories":"Presidents","title":"Remembering JFK","ratings_count":"9","authors":"Jacques Lowe;Hugh Sidey"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":134.43399047851562,"y":241.044677734375,"id":"336","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dk_x45UzKZkwC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1994","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"320","description":"Whistleblowing historian Richard Shenkman skewers the nonsense we were all taught about the world’s revolutions, religions, heroes, and inventors in a whirlwind tour of history.

Marie Antoinette did not say, “Let them eat cake,” Churchill didn’t coin the phrase “the Iron Curtain,” and Caesar never said, “Et tu, Brute?” Scandal in the English monarchy is nothing new: Fifteen kings fathered children out of wedlock.

Under the General Editorship of Michael Cordner, of the University of York, the texts of the plays have been newly edited and are supplemented with a scholarly introduction and detailed annotation.","isbn10":"0192839195","average_rating":"399","categories":"Drama","title":"The Admirable Crichton ; Peter Pan ; When Wendy Grew Up ; What Every Woman Knows ; Mary Rose","ratings_count":"332","authors":"James Matthew Barrie"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":288.2474060058594,"y":-191.11581420898438,"id":"1584","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dCEM1sk7k3XQC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"Terror Stories by Richard Matheson","num_pages":"400","description":"Collects horror stories such as \"Third from the Sun,\" \"Little Girl Lost,\" \"Death Ship,\" and \"Duel,\" which was the basis for the Spielberg film of the same name.","isbn10":"0312878265","average_rating":"405","categories":"Fiction","title":"Duel","ratings_count":"1752","authors":"Richard Matheson"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-430.2827453613281,"y":-440.6587829589844,"id":"1776","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dIKUcAAAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1984","isbn13":"9,78035E+12","num_pages":"236","description":"Willie Whitehorse could have been just another boozed-up guitarist, if it hadn\u0027t been for his songs.

Grant – a man who managed to end the Civil War on a note of grace, serve two terms as president, write one of the most successful military memoirs in American literature, and is today remembered as a brilliant general but a failed president. Ulysses S. Grant was the first officer since George Washington to become a four–star general in the United States Army, and the only president between Andrew Jackson and Woodrow Wilson to serve eight consecutive years in the White House. In this succinct and vivid biography, Michael Korda considers Grant\u0027s character and reconciles the conflicting evaluations of his leadership abilities. Grant\u0027s life played out as a true Horatio Alger story. Despite his humble background as the son of a tanner in Ohio, his lack of early success in the army, and assorted failed business ventures, his unwavering determination propelled him through the ranks of military leadership and into the presidency. But while the general\u0027s tenacity and steadfastness contributed to his success on the battlefield, it both aided and crippled his effectiveness in the White House. Assessing Grant both within the context of his time and in contrast to more recent American leaders, Korda casts a benevolent eye on Grant\u0027s presidency while at the same time conceding his weaknesses. He suggests that though the general\u0027s second term ended in financial and political scandals, the fact remains that for eight years Grant exerted a calming influence on a country that had only just emerged from a horrendous civil war. Ulysses S. Grant is an even–handed and stirring portrait of a man who guided America through a pivotal juncture in its history.","isbn10":"0060590157","average_rating":"373","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Ulysses S.

Although this disease has been at the forefront of public awareness for years, anorexia continues to claim more victims than any other mental illness. Slim to None reveals the glaring inadequacy of the mental health system to treat and fully understand this disease. The first journal of an anorexic to be published posthumously, the book discloses the innermost thoughts, fears, and hopes of a young girl stricken and fighting to recover. Jenny Hendricks painstakingly recorded her experiences as she suffered from and eventually succumbed to this eating disorder. With candor, she recounts being shipped from one doctor to another and subjected to widely varying treatments--all of which ultimately proved unsuccessful.

But as the town gathers to celebrate and honor the beautiful, aging actress with a festival of her old films, Patty is brutally murdered––to the horror and shock of this peaceful burg. A gentle tortoiseshell cat, Kit, has been enjoying a retreat to the animal–loving actress\u0027s inn, where she\u0027s spending time with her feline friends Dulcie, and the slick tomcat sleuth, Joe Grey. But her relaxation is cut short when she hears the gunshots that end Patty\u0027s life, and sees her dead body sprawled on the inn\u0027s front steps. She glimpses the killer racing into the parking garage, and soon follows his trail. Joe and Dulcie must now follow the naïve Kit\u0027s trail, and keep her from getting into serious trouble. To complicate matters, Joe discovers that Dulcie has been hiding a runaway child––one of the lucky humans that these special cats choose to talk to––who has now been kidnapped, likely by the same man who killed their famous friend.

The tales of The Silmarillion are set in an age when Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, dwelt in Middle-Earth, and the High Elves made war upon him for the recovery of the Silmarils, the jewels containing the pure light of Valinor. Included in the book are several shorter works. The Ainulindale is a myth of the Creation and in the Valaquenta the nature and powers of each of the gods is described. The Akallabeth recounts the downfall of the great island kingdom of Numenor at the end of the Second Age and Of the Rings of Power tells of the great events at the end of the Third Age, as narrated in The Lord of the Rings.

From his home in Spain he journeys to the markets of Tangiers and across the Egyptian desert to a fateful encounter with the alchemist.

More than half a century after the publication of A Room Of One\u0027s Own, distinguished scholar Michele Barrett cohesively brings together work which, throughout the years, has been scattered throughout many texts and many volumes. . . affording these very valuable writings the collective distinction they deserve at last.","isbn10":"0156028069","average_rating":"407","categories":"Literary Criticism","title":"Women and Writing","ratings_count":"236","authors":"Virginia Woolf"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":320.8421936035156,"y":126.35687255859375,"id":"1491","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dSPFPCBtIJpMC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2000","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"A Novel","num_pages":"561","description":"The explosion of a jetliner over India triggers an Apocalyptic battle that sweeps across the subcontinent.

Since logic is the study of correct reasoning, it is a fundamental branch of epistemology and a priority in any philosophical system. Philosophers have focused on mathematics as a case study for general philosophical issues and for its role in overall knowledge- gathering. Today, philosophy of mathematics and logic remain central disciplines in contemporary philosophy, as evidenced by the regular appearance of articles on these topics in the best mainstream philosophical journals; in fact, the last decade has seen an explosion of scholarly work in these areas. This volume covers these disciplines in a comprehensive and accessible manner, giving the reader an overview of the major problems, positions, and battle lines. The 26 contributed chapters are by established experts in the field, and their articles contain both exposition and criticism as well as substantial development of their own positions. The essays, which are substantially self-contained, serve both to introduce the reader to the subject and to engage in it at its frontiers. Certain major positions are represented by two chapters--one supportive and one critical. The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Math and Logic is a ground-breaking reference like no other in its field. It is a central resource to those wishing to learn about the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of logic, or some aspect thereof, and to those who actively engage in the discipline, from advanced undergraduates to professional philosophers, mathematicians, and historians.","isbn10":"0195325923","average_rating":"425","categories":"Mathematics","title":"The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic","ratings_count":"19","authors":"Stewart Shapiro"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-304.8943786621094,"y":-61.59417724609375,"id":"1246","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dh0zuAAAAMAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2007","isbn13":"9,7802E+12","subtitle":"Classical and Contemporary Readings","num_pages":"819","description":"Introduction to Philosophy, Fourth Edition, is the most comprehensive topically organized collection of classical and contemporary philosophy available.

Crammed with catastrophe, terror, and ghostly interventions, the novel was an immediate success, and influenced numerous followers. These include William Beckford\u0027s Vathek (1786), which alternates grotesque comedy with scenes of exotic magnificence in the story of the ruthless Caliph Vathek\u0027s journey to damnation. The Monk (1796), by Matthew Lewis, is a violent tale of ambition, murder, and incest, set in the sinister monastery of the Capuchins in Madrid. Frankenstein (1818, 1831) is Mary Shelley\u0027s disturbing and perennially popular tale of young student who learns the secret of giving life to a creature made from human relics, with horrific consequences. This collection illustrates the range and the attraction of the Gothic novel.

Who was \"just seventeen\" and made Paul\u0027s heart go \"boom\"? Was there really an Eleanor Rigby? Where\u0027s Penny Lane? In A Hard Day\u0027s Write, music journalist Steve Turner shatters many well-worn myths and adds a new dimension to the Fab Four\u0027s rich legacy by investigating for the first time the ordinary people and events immortalized in the Beatles\u0027 music and now occupying a special niche in popular culture\u0027s collective imagination. Arranged chronologically by album, the book breaks new ground by exploring how private incidents influenced the group\u0027s writing and how their music evolved. Turner reveals that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was really a drawing by Julian Lennon of his childhood friend; Bungalow Bill was an all-American tiger hunter; Doctor Robert was a New York \u0027speech doctor\u0027; and much more. A longtime Beatles admirer, Turner tracked down and interviewed the real-life subjects of the songs, probed public records and newspaper archives, and spoke in depth to the people closet to the Beatles to unearth tales that have never before been made public. The result is a book that chronicles an untold story of the Beatles themselves. Illustrated with over 200 photographs, A Hard Day\u0027s Write is a visually alluring and highly entertaining journey to the land stretching just beneath your conscious mind, mapped out with strawberry fields, fool-topped hills, and long and winding roads.","isbn10":"0060844094","average_rating":"373","categories":"Music","title":"A Hard Day\u0027s Write, 3e","ratings_count":"152","authors":"Steve Turner"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":144.88516235351562,"y":-201.15823364257812,"id":"615","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003ddrRsu1CjsYIC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1997","isbn13":"9,7801E+12","num_pages":"431","description":"The twin jet plane en route to Denver from Hong Kong is merely a green radar blip half an hour off the California coast when the call comes through to air traffic control: \u0027Socal Approach, this is TransPacific 545.

The winner of a Hugo, a Nebula, and a World Fantasy Award, Vance lays claim to a career that spans more than five decades of critical acclaim and devoted readership. Tor Books has recognized his widespread audience and for years has brought classic Jack Vance novels back into print--most recently The Demon Princes, Volume One, and omnibus containing the first three books of Vance\u0027s beloved Demon Princes series. Tor now presents The Demon Princes, Volume Two, and omnibus containing the series\u0027 final two novels, The Face and The Book of Dreams. Kirth Gersen carries in his pocket a slip of paper with a list of five names written upon it--the names of five Demon Princes. The Demon Princes are a race of beings who disguise themselves as humans and delight in power and destruction. however, to Kirth they are merely murderers who killed his family and destroyed his home planet--and who deserves to die for those misdeeds. Three have already fallen in Kirth\u0027s hands, but there are two more names on his list, two more Princes who will live only long enough to regret their evil ways. Lens Larque was just as unique as the other Demon Princes--uniquely appalling. He was personally ugly, startling vicious, and arrogant above all others. Larque\u0027s own mission was a villainy of the highest order, and his personal obsession with success kept him hidden well from attackers--almost well enough. Howard Alan Treesong poisoned his friends, tortured his colleagues, and wrote his own horrific holy book, The Book of Dreams. But, clever as he may be, a galaxy-wide guessing game will be his undoing--and Kirth Gersen\u0027s sworn vengeance will be complete.","isbn10":"0312865767","average_rating":"43","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Demon Princes, Vol. 2","ratings_count":"641","authors":"Jack Vance"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-336.5588073730469,"y":-471.11334228515625,"id":"141","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dGRhFkTkZba4C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"400","description":"Working as a secretary at the British Embassy on Crete, Nicola Ferris is enjoying a day off when she meets up with two hiking companions who accidentally stumbled into the middle of a terrifying act of vengeance.

The Confessions recreates the world in which he progressed from incompetent engraver to grand success; his enthusiasm for experience, his love of nature, and his uncompromising character make him an ideal guide to eighteenth-century Europe, and he was the author of some of the most profound work ever written on the relation between the individual and the state.","isbn10":"0192822756","average_rating":"362","categories":"Literary Criticism","title":"Confessions","ratings_count":"4755","authors":"Jean-Jacques Rousseau"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":312.3440246582031,"y":-45.714752197265625,"id":"295","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003drL2fOXmLquMC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","subtitle":"A Novel","num_pages":"448","description":"In late 1940s New York City, Cesar and Nestor Castillo, two young Cuban musicians, are dubbed the \"Mambo Kings\" for their talent and rise to superstardom.

The Black Echo (Winner of the Edgar Award for Best First Novel) For Harry Bosch-hero, loner, nighthawk-the body stuffed in a drainpipe off Mulholland Drive isn\u0027t just another statistic. This one is personal. Billy Meadows was a fellow Vietnam \"tunnel rat,\" fighting the VC and the fear they used to call the Black Echo. Harry let Meadows down once. He won\u0027t do it again. The Black Ice The corpse in the hotel room seems to be that of a missing LAPD narcotics officer. Rumors abound that the cop had crossed over-selling a new drug called Black Ice. Now Harry\u0027s making some dangerous connections, leading from the cop to a string of bloody murders, and from Hollywood Boulevard\u0027s drug bazaar to Mexico\u0027s dusty back alleys. In this lethal game, Harry is likely to be the next victim. The Concrete Blonde When Harry Bosch shot and killed Norman Church, the police were convinced it marked the end of the hunt for the Dollmaker-L.A.\u0027s most bizarre serial killer. But now Church\u0027s widow is accusing Harry of killing the wrong man-a charge that rings terrifyingly true when a new victim is discovered with the Dollmaker\u0027s macabre signature. For the second time, Harry must hunt the murderer down, before he strikes again. Together, these three novels are the perfect way to discover, or rediscover, the sleuth the New York Times Book Review called a \"wonderful, old-fashioned hero who isn\u0027t afraid to walk through the flames.\"","isbn10":"0316154970","average_rating":"434","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Harry Bosch Novels","ratings_count":"1966","authors":"Michael Connelly"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-461.5030212402344,"y":-308.762451171875,"id":"233","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003doP3lPQAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"24","description":"Ponies know how to have fun!

Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can\u0027t catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman\u0027s new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman\u0027s nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears. At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen\u0027s Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.","isbn10":"0007149824","average_rating":"373","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Yiddish Policemen\u0027s Union","ratings_count":"51219","authors":"Michael Chabon"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":67.60977172851562,"y":-440.5316467285156,"id":"1122","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dDfiH7n--DBMC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78016E+12","num_pages":"256","description":"Devastated by the abandonment of his wife, Federico de la Fe moves with his young daughter from Mexico to California, where he is unable to break free of feelings of oppression, encounters an unusual woman, and meets another heartbroken man.

The penultimate novel of the Rougon-Macquart cycle, La Debacle (1892) takes as its subject the dramatic events of the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune of 1870-71. During Zola\u0027s lifetime it was the bestselling of all his novels, praised by contemporaries for its epic sweep as well as its attention to historical detail. The novel seeks to explain why the Second Empire ended in a crushing military defeat and revolutionary violence. It focuses on ordinary soldiers, showing their bravery and suffering in the midst of circumstances they cannot control. Zola\u0027s descriptions are some of the most powerful he ever wrote. He skilfully integrates his narrative of events and the fictional lives of his characters to provide the finest account of this tragic chapter in the history of France.

Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity, as misconceptions and hasty judgements lead to heartache and scandal, but eventually to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love.

Ranging from the picaresque to the satirical, Cervantes\u0027s Exemplary Stories defy the conventions of heroic chivalric literature through a combination of comic irony, moral ambiguity, realism, and sheer mirth. With acute narrative skill and deft characterisation, drawing on colloquial language and farce, Cervantes creates a tension between the everyday and the literary, the plausible and the improbable. While encouraging us to reach our own moral conclusions, he also persuades us to accept the coincidental and the incredible: two boys indulge their life of crime at a time of public prayer; a young nobleman undergoes a change of identity at the behest of not a princess but a mere gipsy girl, and, most fantastically, talking dogs philosophize in a ward full of syphilitics. By placing the extraordinary within the contexts of the ordinary, the Exemplary Stories chart new novelistic territory and demonstrate Cervantes at his most imaginative and innovative.

Moore emphasizes the difficulties that inevitably accompany many relationships and focuses on the need to work through these differences in order to experience the deep reward that comes with intimacy and unconfined love.","isbn10":"0060925752","average_rating":"373","categories":"Psychology","title":"Soul Mates","ratings_count":"4122","authors":"Thomas Moore"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-364.8899230957031,"y":88.29339599609375,"id":"1717","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dnJDx-6iUX3YC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78033E+12","num_pages":"202","description":"Stephanie and Rachel have been best friends for years, in spite of their differences.

Those enshrined in its annals are men and women whose ideas, accomplishments, or personalities have dominated, endured, and most important of all, found champions. John F. Kennedy\u0027s Profiles in Courage, Giorgio Vasari\u0027s Lives of the Artists, and Samuel Johnson\u0027s Lives of the Poets are classic celebrations of the greatest, the brightest, the eternally constellated. Paul Collins\u0027 Banvard\u0027s Folly is a different kind of book. Here are thirteen unforgettable portraits of forgotten people: men and women who might have claimed their share of renown but who, whether from ill timing, skullduggery, monomania, the tinge of madness, or plain bad luck-or perhaps some combination of them all-leapt straight from life into thankless obscurity. Among their number are scientists, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, from across the centuries and around the world. They hold in common the silenced aftermath of failure, the name that rings no bells. Collins brings them back to glorious life. John Banvard was an artist whose colossal panoramic canvasses (one behemoth depiction of the entire eastern shore of the Mississippi River was simply known as \"The Three Mile Painting\") made him the richest and most famous artist of his day. . . before he decided to go head to head with P. T. Barnum. René Blondot was a distinguished French physicist whose celebrated discovery of a new form of radiation, called the N-Ray, went terribly awry. At the tender age of seventeen, William Henry Ireland signed \"William Shakespeare\" to a book and launched a short but meteoric career as a forger of undiscovered works by the Bard -- until he pushed his luck too far. John Symmes, a hero of the War of 1812, nearly succeeded in convincing Congress to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where he intended to prove his theory that the earth was hollow and ripe for exploitation; his quixotic quest counted Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe among its greatest admirers. Collins\u0027 love for what he calls the \"forgotten ephemera of genius\" give his portraits of these figures and the other nine men and women in Banvard\u0027s Folly sympathetic depth and poignant relevance. Their effect is not to make us sneer or revel in schadenfreude; here are no cautionary tales. Rather, here are brief introductions-acts of excavation and reclamation-to people whom history may have forgotten, but whom now we cannot.","isbn10":"0312300336","average_rating":"397","categories":"History","title":"Banvard\u0027s Folly","ratings_count":"498","authors":"Paul Collins"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-428.1593017578125,"y":252.67620849609375,"id":"1751","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dupwGPwAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2001","isbn13":"9,78034E+12","num_pages":"256","description":"The first adventure for the Famous Five involves a ruined castle and buried treasure.","isbn10":"0340796146","average_rating":"408","categories":"Adventure stories","title":"Five on a Treasure Island","ratings_count":"18308","authors":"Enid Blyton"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-11.12588119506836,"y":-29.167434692382812,"id":"1019","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d7FkFAQAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"400","description":"Urthstripe the Strong, a wise old badger, leads the animals of the great fortress of Salamandastron and Redwall Abbey against the weasel Ferahgo the Assassin and his corps of vermin.","isbn10":"0142501522","average_rating":"406","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"Salamandastron","ratings_count":"25484","authors":"Brian Jacques;Gary Chalk"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-6.082729339599609,"y":-226.998291015625,"id":"84","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003djHE-PgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78001E+12","num_pages":"208","description":"A study guide for the novel There\u0027s a Boy in the Girl\u0027s bathroom.","isbn10":"0007178638","average_rating":"373","categories":"Boys","title":"There\u0027s a Boy in the Girls\u0027 Bathroom","ratings_count":"174","authors":"Louis Sachar"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":289.2569274902344,"y":-470.2206726074219,"id":"623","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dO9E8gGrjhj4C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1998","isbn13":"9,7801E+12","num_pages":"432","description":"In American Pastoral, Philip Roth gives us a novel of unqualified greatness that is an elegy for all the twentieth century\u0027s promises of prosperity, civic order, and domestic bliss.

Red-hot screwball comedies, each and every one of them. Nine of these stories were originally published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. All immediately went out of print and could be found only at used bookstores and yard sales. I\u0027m excited to tell you that those nine stories are now being re-released by HarperCollins. Back to the Bedroom is presented here in almost original form. I\u0027ve done only minor editing to correct some embarrassing bloopers missed the first time around. I lived in northern Virginia when I wrote Back to the Bedroom. My children were young, and we spent a lot of time visiting the Washington, D.C. museums and wandering through the historic neighborhoods. One day while strolling Capitol Hill I came upon two townhouses that captured my imagination. The houses were totally different -- a birthday cake of a house and a bran muffin of a house, and yet they shared a common wall. I wondered about the people who lived inside the houses. And eventually the houses inspired Back to the Bedroom. Back to the Bedroom is the story of a young woman with the soul of a birthday cake living in a bran muffin house -- and a nice-looking guy with the substance of a bran muffin living in a birthday cake. They share some misadventures, some romantic moments, some misunderstandings, and ultimately they turn into wedding cake. And for Plum fans, you\u0027ll be interested to find that this was the first of the four romances to feature Elsie Hawkins, the prototype for Grandma Mazur.

The novel deals with the events of one day in Dublin, 16th June 1904, now known as \"Bloomsday\". The principal characters are Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom and his wife Molly. Ulysses has been labelled dirty, blasphemous and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it not quite obscene enough to disallow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce\u0027s \"cloacal obsession\". None of these descriptions, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains the modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in its own way) suspenseful.

Ancient Greek and Roman society had many gods and an addiction to astrology and divination. This introduction to the period traces the process by which Christianitychanged this and so provided a foundation for the modern world: the teaching of Jesus created a lasting community, which grew to command the allegiance of the Roman emperor. Christianity is discussed in relation to how it appeared to both Jews and pagans, and how its Christian doctrine and practicewere shaped in relation to Graeco-Roman culture and the Jewish matrix. Among the major figures discussed are Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Constantine, Julian the Apostate, Basil, Ambrose, and Augustine.Following a chronological approach, Henry Chadwick\u0027s clear exposition of important texts and theological debates in their historical context is unrivalled in detail. In particular, theological and ecclesial texts are examined in relation to the behaviour and beliefs of people who attended churchesand synagogues. Christians did not find agreement and unity easy and the author displays a distinctive concern for the factors - theological, personal, and political - which caused division in the church and prevented reconciliation. The emperors, however, began to foster unity for political reasonsand to choose monotheism. Finally, the Church captured the society.","isbn10":"0199265771","average_rating":"421","categories":"Religion","title":"The Church in Ancient Society","ratings_count":"14","authors":"Henry Chadwick"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":117.11837768554688,"y":-176.64971923828125,"id":"961","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003djJLdC4jLv0YC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2001","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"64","description":"Bridget Jones, the main character in the novel and the film, \"Bridget Jones\u0027s Diary,\" shares her own ideas on homemaking, cooking, relationships, weight loss, and other subjects in a parody of a self-help book.","isbn10":"0142000213","average_rating":"348","categories":"Fiction","title":"Bridget Jones\u0027s Guide to Life","ratings_count":"1083","authors":"Helen Fielding"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-32.853328704833984,"y":80.7120361328125,"id":"393","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d9__w-OOjLuAC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1999","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"288","description":"When Karen Ann MacNeil awakens after being in a coma for eighteen years, the world suddenly encounters disturbing, terrifying, and radical changes that alter reality, and Karen and her friends must try to stop the madness and restore order to the world.

We all have heard the story of Cinderella, the beautiful child cast out to slave among the ashes.

What fate befell those untouched by beauty . . . and what curses accompanied Cinderella\u0027s exquisite looks?

Iris\u0027s path quickly becomes intertwined with that of Clara, the mysterious and unnaturally beautiful girl destined to become her sister. Clara was the prettiest child, but was her life the prettiest tale? While Clara retreats to the cinders of the family hearth, burning all memories of her past, Iris seeks out the shadowy secrets of her new household--and the treacherous truth of her former life.

This remarkable debut book chronicles what has happened in Rwanda and neighboring states since 1994, when the Rwandan government called on everyone in the Hutu majority to murder everyone in the Tutsi minority. Though the killing was low-tech--largely by machete--it was carried out at shocking speed: some 800,000 people were exterminated in a hundred days. A Tutsi pastor, in a letter to his church president, a Hutu, used the chilling phrase that gives Philip Gourevitch his title. With keen dramatic intensity, Gourevitch frames the genesis and horror of Rwanda\u0027s \"genocidal logic\" in the anguish of its aftermath: the mass displacements, the temptations of revenge and the quest for justice, the impossibly crowded prisons and refugee camps. Through intimate portraits of Rwandans in all walks of life, he focuses on the psychological and political challenges of survival and on how the new leaders of postcolonial Africa went to war in the Congo when resurgent genocidal forces threatened to overrun central Africa. Can a country composed largely of perpetrators and victims create a cohesive national society? This moving contribution to the literature of witness tells us much about the struggle everywhere to forge sane, habitable political orders, and about the stubbornness of the human spirit in a world of extremity.

In just six lovely weeks in the spring and summer of 1940 a single battle brought down in total military defeat one of the world\u0027s oldest, greatest, and most civilized powers—the second mightiest empire on earth and the possessor of one of the finest military machines ever assembled. How did it happen? After nearly a decade of research in the massive archives left from World War II and after hundreds of conversations with the Third Republic’s leaders, generals, diplomats, and ordinary citizens, Shirer presents the definitive answer in his stunning re-creation of why and how France fell before Hitler\u0027s armies in 1940. His book is also a devastating examination of the confusion, corruption, and cynicism that drained the strength and toughness of a democracy which Thomas Jefferson once called \"every man\u0027s second country.\" This book complements and completes the dramatic story of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and continues to rank as one of the most important works of history of our time.","isbn10":"0306805626","average_rating":"42","categories":"History","title":"The Collapse of the Third Republic","ratings_count":"497","authors":"William Lawrence Shirer"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":201.07748413085938,"y":-45.462860107421875,"id":"1348","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003djGG3QgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78026E+12","num_pages":"393","description":"The third volume that contains the early myths and legends which led to the writing of Tolkien\u0027s epic tale of war, The Silmarillion.

Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia. For the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations. This edition presents all seven books -- unabridged -- in one impressive volume. The books are presented here according to Lewis\u0027 preferred order, each chapter graced with an illustration by the original artist, Pauline Baynes.

Feist returns to his signature world of Midkemia in this first book in a gripping new trilogy that ushers in the third, and most dramatic, Riftwar yet: the Darkwar. In the middle of the night on Sorcerer\u0027s Isle, the powerful sorcerer Pug is awakened from a nightmare that portends destruction for all of Midkemia. Disturbed by the dream, Pug calls for a convening of the Conclave of Shadows. Though Pug does not yet know it, his son Magnus has discovered the cause of Pug\u0027s prophetic dream: a beacon has been unleashed, directing a vast army of alien invaders to Midkemia, an army so formidable that even the might of the Tsurani Empire might fall before its fury. Meanwhile, in far Stardock town, two boys are coming of age. But on the dusty path that leads them from home they are thrust by fate into a life undreamed of, becoming enmeshed in intrigue, murder, and treason. Though untrained and unready, they are called upon by the mysterious Conclave to travel deep into the heart of the Empire of Great Kesh, to confront a plot so dark and twisted it will implicate even the highest-ranking nobles of the Empire, even members of the royal family itself. And behind this plot they discover the ancient Brotherhood of Death, the clan of assassins known as the Nighthawks. And Pug will find himself once again facing his old nemesis, the evil wizard formerly known as Sidi, now Leso Varen, in a confrontation with everything at stake: his honor, his life, and the future of Midkemia.","isbn10":"0060792787","average_rating":"373","categories":"Fiction","title":"Flight of the Nighthawks","ratings_count":"9378","authors":"Raymond E.

Zizek inverts current pedagogicalstrategies to explain the difficult philosophical underpinnings of the French theoretician andpractician who revolutionized our view of psychoanalysis. He approaches Lacan through the motifs andworks of contemporary popular culture, from Hitchcock\u0027s Vertigo to Stephen King\u0027s Pet Sematary, fromMcCullough\u0027s An Indecent Obsession to Romero\u0027s Return of the Living Dead - a strategy of \"lookingawry\" that recalls the exhilarating and vital experience of Lacan.Zizek discovers fundamentalLacanian categories the triad Imaginary/Symbolic/Real, the object small a, the opposition of driveand desire, the split subject - at work in horror fiction, in detective thrillers, in romances, inthe mass media\u0027s perception of ecological crisis, and, above all, in Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s films. Theplayfulness of Zizek\u0027s text, however, is entirely different from that associated with thedeconstructive approach made famous by Derrida. By clarifying what Lacan is saying as well as whathe is not saying, Zizek is uniquely able to distinguish Lacan from the poststructuralists who sooften claim him.Slavoj Zizek is a Researcher in the Institute of Sociology at the University ofLjubljana, Yugoslavia.

Although employed as a Privy Councillor at the Duke of Weimar�s court, where he helped oversee major mining, road-building and irrigation projects, he also painted, directed plays, carried out research in anatomy, botany and optics � and still found time to produce masterpieces in every literary genre.

Everyone wants to be their friend (or, if single, their lover!) In business, they rise swiftly to the top of the corporate ladder. What is their \"Midas touch?\" What it boils down to is a more skillful way of dealing with people. The author has spent her career teaching people how to communicate for success.

The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendía family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel García Márquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master. Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.","isbn10":"0060531045","average_rating":"373","categories":"Fiction","title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","ratings_count":"547207","authors":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-214.54031372070312,"y":-235.74639892578125,"id":"583","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dZA0yS2C37r4C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,7801E+12","num_pages":"325","description":"A wonderful and terrifying series by a new writer about a young boy training to be an exorcist.

Often, there is much more going on in a novel or poem than is readily visible on the surface—a symbol, maybe, that remains elusive, or an unexpected twist on a character—and there\u0027s that sneaking suspicion that the deeper meaning of a literary text keeps escaping you. In this practical and amusing guide to literature, Thomas C. Foster shows how easy and gratifying it is to unlock those hidden truths, and to discover a world where a road leads to a quest; a shared meal may signify a communion; and rain, whether cleansing or destructive, is never just rain.

After centuries of pogrom-like riots encouraged by the Church, the Jews - who have been an important part of Spanish life since the days of the Romans - are expelled from the country by royal edict. Many who wish to remain are intimidated by Church and Crown and become Catholics, but several hundred thousand choose to retain their religion and depart; given little time to flee, some perish even before they can escape from Spain. Yonah Toledano, the 15-year-old son of a celebrated Spanish silversmith, has seen his father and brother die during these terrible days - victims whose murders go almost unnoticed in a time of mass upheaval. Trapped in Spain by circumstances, he is determined to honor the memory of his family by remaining a Jew. On a donkey named Moise, Yonah begins a meandering journey, a young fugitive zigzagging across the vastness of Spain. Toiling at manual labor, he desperately tries to cling to his memories of a vanished culture. As a lonely shepherd on a mountaintop he hurls snatches of almost forgotten Hebrew at the stars, as an apprentice armorer he learns to fight like a Christian knight. Finally, as a man living in a time and land where danger from the Inquisition is everywhere, he deals with the questions that mark his past. How he discovers the answers, how he finds his way to a singular and strong Marrano woman, how he achieves a life with the outer persona of a respected Old Christian physician and the inner life of a secret Jew, is the fabric of this novel. The Last Jew is a glimpse of the past, an authentic tale of high adventure, and a tender and unforgettable love story.

She can accept her father\u0027s warning that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, because mockingbirds harm no one and give great pleasure. The benefits said to be gained from going to school and keeping her temper elude her. The place of this enchanting, intensely moving story is Maycomb, Alabama. The time is the Depression, but Scout and her brother, Jem, are seldom depressed. They have appalling gifts for entertaining themselves—appalling, that is, to almost everyone except their wise lawyer father, Atticus. Atticus is a man of unfaltering good will and humor, and partly because of this, the children become involved in some disturbing adult mysteries: fascinating Boo Radley, who never leaves his house; the terrible temper of Mrs. Dubose down the street; the fine distinctions that make the Finch family \"quality\"; the forces that cause the people of Maycomb to show compassion in one crisis and unreasoning cruelty in another. Also because Atticus is what he is, and because he lives where he does, he and his children are plunged into a conflict that indelibly marks their lives—and gives Scout some basis for thinking she knows just about as much about the world as she needs to.","isbn10":"0061205699","average_rating":"373","categories":"Fiction","title":"To Kill a Mockingbird (slipcased edition)","ratings_count":"250","authors":"Harper Lee"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-252.91653442382812,"y":143.20953369140625,"id":"1539","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dAaXWxQEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","num_pages":"510","description":"A new compilation of interviews from the premier literary magazine includes conversations with some of the world\u0027s leading authors, poets, novelists, playwrights, and memoirists, including William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Graham Gre","isbn10":"0312361750","average_rating":"438","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"The Paris Review Interviews, I","ratings_count":"838","authors":"The Paris Review"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":45.84341812133789,"y":-295.063720703125,"id":"352","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dxl1mxRJd00MC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1999","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","subtitle":"A Novel","num_pages":"546","description":"Nathan Price, a evangelical Baptist who in 1959 has taken his wife and four daughters on a mission to the Belgian Congo, finds that their traditions are no longer secure in this very different world.

But in this sweeping overview of the rise of civilization, Robert O\u0027Connell finds that war is indeed an invention--an institution that arosedue to very specific historical circumstances, an institution that now verges on extinction. In Ride of the Second Horseman, O\u0027Connell probes the distant human past to show how and why war arose. He begins with a definition that distinguishes between war and mere feuding: war involves group rather than individual issues, political or economic goals, and direction by some governmentalstructure, carried out with the intention of lasting results. With this definition, he finds that ants are the only other creatures that conduct it--battling other colonies for territory and slaves. But ants, unlike humans, are driven by their genes; in humans, changes in our culture and subsistencepatterns, not our genetic hardware, brought the rise of organized warfare. O\u0027Connell draws on anthropology and archeology to locate the rise of war sometime after the human transition from nomadic hunting and gathering to agriculture, when society split between farmers and pastoralists. Around 5500BC, these pastoralists initiated the birth of war with raids on Middle Eastern agricultural settlements. The farmers responded by ringing their villages with walls, setting off a process of further social development, intensified combat, and ultimately the rise of complex urban societies dependentupon warfare to help stabilize what amounted to highly volatile population structures, beset by frequent bouts of famine and epidemic disease. In times of overpopulation, the armies either conquered new lands or self-destructed, leaving fewer mouths to feed. In times of underpopulation, slaves weretaken to provide labor. O\u0027Connell explores the histories of the civilizations of ancient Sumeria, Egypt, Assyria, China, and the New World, showing how war came to each and how it adapted to varying circumstances. On the other hand, societies based on trade employed war much more selectively andpragmatically. Thus, Minoan Crete, long protected from marauding pastoralists, developed a wealthy mercantile society marked by unmilitaristic attitudes, equality between men and women, and a relative absence of class distinctions. In Assyria, by contrast, war came to be an end in itself, in aculture dominated by male warriors. Despite the violence in the world today, O\u0027Connell finds reason for hope. The industrial revolution broke the old patterns of subsistence: war no longer serves the demographic purpose it once did. Fascinating and provocative, Ride of the Second Horseman offers a far-reaching tour of human historythat suggests the age-old cycle of war may now be near its end.","isbn10":"0195119207","average_rating":"423","categories":"History","title":"Ride of the Second Horseman","ratings_count":"12","authors":"Robert L.

This Penguin Classics edition is edited by Stella McNichol with an introduction and notes by Elaine Showalter.Past, present and future are brought together one momentous June day in 1923.Clarissa Dalloway, elegant and vivacious, is preparing for a party while reminiscing about her childhood romance with Peter Walsh, and dwelling on her daughter Elizabeth\u0027s rapidly-approaching adulthood. In another part of London, war veteran Septimus Smith is shell-shocked and on the brink of madness, slowly spiralling towards self-annihilation. Their experiences mingling, yet never quite meeting, Virginia Woolf masterfully portrays a serendipitous unity of inner lives, converging as the party reaches its glittering climax. Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) is regarded as a major 20th century author and essayist, a key figure in literary history as a feminist and modernist, and the centre of \u0027The Bloomsbury Group\u0027. This informal collective of artists and writers which included Lytton Strachey and Roger Fry, exerted a powerful influence over early twentieth-century British culture. Between 1925 and 1931 Virginia Woolf produced what are now regarded as her finest masterpieces, from Mrs Dalloway(1925) to the poetic and highly experimental novel The Waves(1931). She also maintained an astonishing output of literary criticism, short fiction, journalism and biography, including the playfully subversive Orlando(1928) and A Room of One\u0027s Own(1929) a passionate feminist essay.If you enjoyed Mrs Dalloway, you might like James Joyce\u0027s Ulysses, also available in Penguin Classics.\u0027The book\u0027s celebrated stream of consciousness is one of the few genuine innovations in the history of the novel\u0027New Yorker","isbn10":"0141182490","average_rating":"379","categories":"Fiction","title":"Mrs Dalloway","ratings_count":"2128","authors":"Virginia Woolf"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-36.927547454833984,"y":-469.77081298828125,"id":"772","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003doYAsTM2q0rEC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1977","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"1072","description":"Contains all of Blake\u0027s poetry with full annotation and a glossary of proper names.","isbn10":"0140422153","average_rating":"429","categories":"Literary Criticism","title":"The Complete Poems","ratings_count":"7584","authors":"William Blake"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-4.313167572021484,"y":389.20098876953125,"id":"1470","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dalQE3M4q-u4C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1997","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"A Listener\u0027s Diary","num_pages":"256","description":"A self-proclaimed member of Generation X examines what is on the radio day-by-day and how she as an audience interacts with it from morning to night, in a car, at home, and in the office","isbn10":"0312183011","average_rating":"342","categories":"Literary Collections","title":"Radio On","ratings_count":"1468","authors":"Sarah Vowell"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":406.8256530761719,"y":-422.6518859863281,"id":"1603","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003diLMQi0lFhcoC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2007","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","num_pages":"281","description":"Far too busy to get involved with men or marriage, Cate Madigan spends her time in school and working as a bartender, but her life changes when she encounters ex-cop Kellen McBride, a man who quickly draws her into danger.","isbn10":"0312941463","average_rating":"374","categories":"Fiction","title":"Hot Stuff","ratings_count":"9068","authors":"Janet Evanovich;Leanne Banks"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":165.66348266601562,"y":-480.8208923339844,"id":"1115","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dNVM6vgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2007","isbn13":"9,78016E+12","subtitle":"Tales of Mystery and Suspense","num_pages":"275","description":"A collection of short works includes \"So Help Me God,\" in which a young wife wonders about the identity of a flirtatious caller, and \"Madison at Guignol,\" in which an unhappy fashionista discovers a horrendous secret at a clothing store.","isbn10":"0156030276","average_rating":"36","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Female of the Species","ratings_count":"994","authors":"Joyce Carol Oates"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":247.03805541992188,"y":-325.317626953125,"id":"329","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dg8KrkJIcFgYC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1990","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"229","description":"John Buddy Pearson, a young Black man who becomes a popular pastor at Zion Hope, is unable to reconcile his good intentions and his natural instincts","isbn10":"0060916516","average_rating":"373","categories":"Fiction","title":"Jonah\u0027s Gourd Vine","ratings_count":"1619","authors":"Zora Neale Hurston"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-189.262939453125,"y":-15.850983619689941,"id":"1749","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d8p8VNgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2001","isbn13":"9,78034E+12","num_pages":"470","description":"Just graduated from drama school, Lizzie Jordan is looking forward to a glittering career at the RSC.

As part of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, the first steam-powered vessels ever to search for the legendary Northwest Passage, they are as scientifically supported an enterprise as has ever set forth. As they enter a second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships buckling in the grip of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror constantly clawing to get in.When the expedition\u0027s leader, Sir John Franklin, meets a terrible death, Captain Francis Crozier takes command and leads his surviving crewmen on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the ice. With them travels an Inuit woman who cannot speak and who may be the key to survival, or the harbinger of their deaths. But as another winter approaches, as scurvy and starvation grow more terrible, and as the terror on the ice stalks them southward, Crozier and his men begin to fear that there is no escape. The Terror swells with the heart-stopping suspense and heroic adventure that have won Dan Simmons praise as \"a writer who not only makes big promises but keeps them\" (Seattle Post-Intelligencer). With a haunting and constantly surprising story based on actual historical events, The Terror is a novel that will chill you to your core.","isbn10":"0316017442","average_rating":"405","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Terror","ratings_count":"28640","authors":"Dan Simmons"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-336.7644348144531,"y":-85.65301513671875,"id":"383","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dZesncyxxr5YC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1992","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"640","description":"A national bestseller, voted by Time as the #1 novel of 1991, selected as one of the \"Best Books of 1991\" by Publishers Weekly, and nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award--a magnificent story that probes the meaning of love, science, music, and art, by the brilliant author of Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance.","isbn10":"0060975008","average_rating":"373","categories":"Fiction","title":"Gold Bug Variations","ratings_count":"1383","authors":"Richard Powers"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-231.07577514648438,"y":90.01763916015625,"id":"1076","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d9OdooYJSetgC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78015E+12","num_pages":"44","description":"Jeremy Jacob joins Braid Beard and his pirate crew and finds out about pirate language, pirate manners, and other aspects of their life.","isbn10":"0152018484","average_rating":"408","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"How I Became a Pirate","ratings_count":"23328","authors":"Melinda Long;David Shannon"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-267.21417236328125,"y":165.03131103515625,"id":"1363","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dG-4EyYR-QgMC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2001","isbn13":"9,78026E+12","num_pages":"354","description":"A stimulating, eclectic accountof new media that finds its origins in old media, particularly the cinema.

He also analyzes categories and forms unique to new media, such as interface and database. Manovich uses concepts from film theory, art history, literary theory, and computer science and also develops new theoretical constructs, such as cultural interface, spatial montage, and cinegratography. The theory and history of cinema play a particularly important role in the book. Among other topics, Manovich discusses parallels between the histories of cinema and of new media, digital cinema, screen and montage in cinema and in new media, and historical ties between avant-garde film and new media.","isbn10":"0262632551","average_rating":"385","categories":"Art","title":"The Language of New Media","ratings_count":"798","authors":"Lev Manovich;Roger F.

Moelwyn Merchant with an introduction by Peter Holland. \u0027The quality of mercy is not strain\u0027d, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\u0027 Bassanio, a noble but impoverished Venetian, asks his friend the merchant Antonio for a loan to impress an heiress. Antonio agrees, but is forced to borrow the sum from a cynical Jewish moneylender, Shylock, who forces him into a chilling contract, which stipulates he must honour the debt with a pound of his own flesh. But Bassanio\u0027s beloved is not as demure as she seems, and disguising herself as a lawyer, Portia proves herself one of Shakespeare\u0027s most cunning heroines, in a witty attack on Shylock\u0027s claim. A complex and controversial comedy, The Merchant of Venice explores prejudice and the true nature of justice. This book contains a general introduction to Shakespeare\u0027s life and Elizabethan theatre, a separate introduction to The Merchant of Venice, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, an essay discussing performance options on both stage and screen, and a commentary. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was born to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden some time in late April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. He wrote about 38 plays (the precise number is uncertain), many of which are regarded as the most exceptional works of drama ever produced, including Romeo and Juliet (1595), Henry V (1599), Hamlet (1601), Othello (1604), King Lear (1606) and Macbeth (1606), as well as a collection of 154 sonnets, which number among the most profound and influential love-poetry in English.

Now, in Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining. \"Believing in Jesus does not mean believing doctrines about him,\" Borg writes. \"Rather, it means to give one\u0027s heart, one\u0027s self at its deepest level, to . . . the living Lord.\" Drawing on his own journey from a naive, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life—one not rooted in creeds or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community. In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus\u0027 character: spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement founder. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus, showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith. For questioning believers, doubters, and reluctant unbelievers alike, Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time frees our understanding of Jesus\u0027 life and message from popular misconceptions and outlines the way to a sound and contemporary faith: \"For ultimately, Jesus is not simply a figure of the past, but a figure of the present. Meeting that Jesus—the living one who comes to us even now—will be like meeting Jesus again for the first time.\"","isbn10":"0060609176","average_rating":"373","categories":"Religion","title":"Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time","ratings_count":"3998","authors":"Marcus J.

There are situations in which we fail for a moment to recognize the person we are with, in which the identity of the other is erased while we simultaneously doubt our own. That also happens with couples -- indeed, above all with couples, because lovers fear more than anything else \"losing sight\" of the loved one. With stunning artfulness in expanding and playing variations on the meaningful moment, Milan Kundera has made this situation -- and the vague sense of panic it inspires -- the very fabric of his new novel. Here brevity goes hand in hand with intensity, and a moment of bewilderment marks the start of a labyrinthine journey during which the reader repeatedly crosses the border between the real and the unreal, between what occurs in the world outside and what the mind creates in its solitude. Of all contemporary writers, only Kundera can transform such a hidden and disconcerting perception into the material for a novel, one of his finest, most painful, and most enlightening.

They are found in all complex living things, and in that sense, they are fundamental for driving complex life on the planet. But there is much more to them than that. Mitochondria have their own DNA, with their own small collection of genes, separate from those in the cell nucleus. It is thought that they were once bacteria living independent lives. Their enslavement within the larger cell was a turning point in the evolution of life, enabling the development of complex organisms and, closely related, the origin of two sexes. Unlike the DNA in the nucleus, mitochondrial DNA is passed down exclusively (or almost exclusively) via the female line. That\u0027s why it has been used by some researchers to trace human ancestry daughter-to-mother, to \u0027Mitochondrial Eve\u0027. Mitochondria give us important information about our evolutionary history. And that\u0027s not all. Mitochondrial genes mutate much faster than those in the nucleus because of the free radicals produced in their energy-generating role. This high mutation rate lies behind our ageing and certain congenital diseases. The latest research suggests that mitochondria play a key role in degenerative diseases such as cancer, through their involvement in precipitating cell suicide. Mitochondria, then, are pivotal in power, sex, and suicide. In this fascinating and thought-provoking book, Nick Lane brings together the latest research findings in this exciting field to show how our growing understanding of mitochondria is shedding light on how complex life evolved, why sex arose (why don\u0027t we just bud?), and why we age and die. This understanding is of fundamental importance, both in understanding how we and all other complex life came to be, but also in order to be able to control our own illnesses, and delay our degeneration and death. \u0027An extraordinary account of groundbreaking modern science...

In this book, R.E. Allen provides a superb translation of the Parmenides along with a structural analysis that procedes on the assumption that formal elements, logical and dramatic, are important to its interpretation and that the argument of the Parmenides is aporetic, a statement of metaphysical perplexities. Allen\u0027s original translation of and commentary on the Parmenides were published in 1983 to great acclaim and have now been revised by the author.","isbn10":"0300044887","average_rating":"414","categories":"Philosophy","title":"Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Meno, Gorgias, Menexenus","ratings_count":"112","authors":"Plato"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-460.79193115234375,"y":358.29144287109375,"id":"696","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dy408PgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1995","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"A Play in Four Acts","num_pages":"176","description":"A play revealing the Salem witch trials of the late seventeenth century and the problem of guilt by association","isbn10":"0140189645","average_rating":"357","categories":"Drama","title":"The Crucible","ratings_count":"1297","authors":"Arthur Miller"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-114.33343505859375,"y":141.9111328125,"id":"311","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dYapzZwOTEDoC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"357","description":"At the end of the nineteenth century, nine-year-old Almanzo lives with his family on a big farm in New York State where he raises his own two calves, helps cut ice and shear sheep, and longs for the day he can have his own colt.","isbn10":"0060885386","average_rating":"373","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"Farmer Boy","ratings_count":"44132","authors":"Laura Ingalls Wilder"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-327.7890930175781,"y":437.56982421875,"id":"1417","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003deMq_lTq6fUgC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","num_pages":"241","description":"In a novel set in an indefinite, futuristic, post-apocalyptic world, a father and his young son make their way through the ruins of a devastated American landscape, struggling to survive and preserve the last remnants of their own humanity. 250,000 first printing.","isbn10":"0307265439","average_rating":"396","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Road","ratings_count":"574745","authors":"Cormac McCarthy"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-376.2542419433594,"y":-476.1292419433594,"id":"1552","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dttcEu4iDvnYC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"A Novel","num_pages":"329","description":"The protagonist, a Humanist-in-Residence at the center for Advanced Scientific Research, gets involved with a project to train a machine to pass a comprehensive exam in English literature--and with the degree candidate against whom the machine is competing.

In this, the first volume, Manchester follows Churchill from his birth to 1932, when he began to warn against the re-militarization of Germany. Born of an American mother and the gifted but unstable son of a duke, his childhood was one of wretched neglect. He sought glory on the battlefields of Cuba, Sudan, India, South Africa and the trenches of France. In Parliament he was the prime force behind the creation of Iraq and Jordan, laid the groundwork for the birth of Israel, and negotiated the independence of the Irish Free State. Yet, as Chancellor of the Exchequer he plunged England into economic crisis, and his fruitless attempt to suppress Gandhi\u0027s quest for Indian independence brought political chaos to Britain. Throughout, Churchill learned the lessons that would prepare him for the storm to come, and as the 1930\u0027s began, he readied himself for the coming battle against Nazism--an evil the world had never before seen.","isbn10":"0316545031","average_rating":"443","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Last Lion, The: Volume 1","ratings_count":"328","authors":"William Manchester"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-250.94061279296875,"y":502.16998291015625,"id":"704","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d2p8BAAAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2000","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"101 Ways of Seeing Yourself","num_pages":"224","description":"A noted artist introduces 101 easy-to-follow ways to help readers identify their personal abilities, personality types, psychological strategies, and goals, examining the body, emotions, intellect, and spirit.","isbn10":"0140196099","average_rating":"348","categories":"Body, Mind \u0026 Spirit","title":"Who are You?","ratings_count":"250","authors":"Malcolm Godwin"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":403.2834167480469,"y":93.93231201171875,"id":"853","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dblqrNAEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1981","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"32","description":"The noisy children of three neighboring families have a gay time at Christmas baking cookies, cutting and decorating trees, eating fruitcake and tarts, and opening Christmas gifts.","isbn10":"0140503447","average_rating":"418","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"Christmas in Noisy Village","ratings_count":"797","authors":"Astrid Lindgren;Ilon Wikland"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-4.147182464599609,"y":299.46270751953125,"id":"1768","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d93J5ancJm7kC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1977","isbn13":"9,78035E+12","num_pages":"450","isbn10":"0345253590","average_rating":"422","categories":"Fiction","title":"The best of Philip K.

By the time Goethe\u0027s Theory of Colours appeared in 1810, the wavelength theory of light and color had been firmly established. To Goethe, the theory was the result of mistaking an incidental result for an elemental principle. Far from pretending to a knowledge of physics, he insisted that such knowledge was an actual hindrance to understanding. He based his conclusions exclusively upon exhaustive personal observation of the phenomena of color. Of his own theory, Goethe was supremely confident: \"From the philosopher, we believe we merit thanks for having traced the phenomena of colours to their first sources, to the circumstances under which they appear and are, and beyond which no further explanation respecting them is possible.\" Goethe\u0027s scientific conclusions have, of course, long since been thoroughly demolished, but the intelligent reader of today may enjoy this work on quite different grounds: for the beauty and sweep of his conjectures regarding the connection between color and philosophical ideas; for an insight into early nineteenth-century beliefs and modes of thought; and for the flavor of life in Europe just after the American and French Revolutions. The book does not have to be studied to be appreciated. Goethe\u0027s subjective theory of colors permits him to speak most persuasively of color harmony and aesthetics. In some readers these notions will evoke a positive response on their merits. Others may regard them as pure fantasy, but savor the grace and style of their exposition. The work may also be read as an accurate guide to the study of color phenomena. Goethe\u0027s conclusions have been repudiated, but no one quarrels with his reporting of the facts to be observed. With simple objects--vessels, prisms, lenses, and the like--the reader will be led through a demonstration course not only in subjectively produced colors, but also in the observable physical phenomena of color. By closely following Goethe\u0027s explanations of the color phenomena, the reader may become so divorced from the wavelength theory--Goethe never even mentions it--that he may begin to think about color theory relatively unhampered by prejudice, ancient or modern.","isbn10":"0262570211","average_rating":"407","categories":"Art","title":"Theory of Colours","ratings_count":"669","authors":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe;Donald Eastlake"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":127.21041870117188,"y":-165.83010864257812,"id":"1059","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dQO2PngEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"557","description":"Set against the backdrop of decadent Parisian high society and the rise of a conservative bourgeoisie that will supplant it, the author explores the theme of homosexual love and the destructive influence of sexual jealousy.","isbn10":"0143039318","average_rating":"436","categories":"Fiction","title":"Sodom and Gomorrah","ratings_count":"3039","authors":"Marcel Proust"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":99.46450805664062,"y":-348.0902099609375,"id":"464","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003deDMIwLHwKOcC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1991","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","subtitle":"Our Great Wisdom Traditions","num_pages":"416","description":"Provides an introduction to Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and the native traditions of the Americas, Australia, Africa, and Oceania","isbn10":"0062508113","average_rating":"407","categories":"History","title":"The World\u0027s Religions","ratings_count":"8383","authors":"Huston Smith"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-22.855464935302734,"y":-309.7295227050781,"id":"553","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dQiCJsEpVj3MC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1994","isbn13":"9,7801E+12","subtitle":"A Confession","num_pages":"400","description":"What If A Look-Alike Stranger Stole Your Name, Usurped Your Biography, And Went About The World Pretending To Be You?

This powerful work of speculative fiction sheds a blazing critical light on the present and is considered to be Huxley\u0027s most enduring masterpiece. Following Brave New World is the nonfiction work Brave New World Revisited, first published in 1958.

This Penguin Classics edition is translated from the Greek by J.A.K. Thomson with revisions and notes by Hugh Tredennick, and an introduction and bibliography by Jonathan Barnes. \u0027One swallow does not make a summer; neither does one day. Similarly neither can one day, or a brief space of time, make a man blessed and happy\u0027 In The Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle sets out to examine the nature of happiness. He argues that happiness consists in \u0027activity of the soul in accordance with virtue\u0027, for example with moral virtues, such as courage, generosity and justice, and intellectual virtues, such as knowledge, wisdom and insight. The Ethics also discusses the nature of practical reasoning, the value and the objects of pleasure, the different forms of friendship, and the relationship between individual virtue, society and the State. Aristotle\u0027s work has had a profound and lasting influence on all subsequent Western thought about ethical matters. Aristotle (384-22 BC) studied at the Academy of Plato for 20 years and then established his own school and research institute, \u0027The Lyceum\u0027. His writings, which were of extraordinary range, profoundly affected the whole course of ancient and medieval philosophy and are still eagerly studied and debated by philosophers today.

As other perspectives on antitrust law have fallen away, Posner\u0027s book has played a major role in transforming the field of antitrust law into a body of economically rational principles largely in accord with the ideas set forth in the first edition. Today\u0027s antitrust professionals may disagree on specific practices and rules, but most litigators, prosecutors, judges, and scholars agree that the primary goal of antitrust laws should be to promote economic welfare, and that economic theory should be used to determine how well business practices conform to that goal. In this thoroughly revised edition, Posner explains the economic approach to new generations of lawyers and students. He updates and amplifies his approach as it applies to the developments, both legal and economic, in the antitrust field since 1976. The \"new economy,\" for example, has presented a host of difficult antitrust questions, and in an entirely new chapter, Posner explains how the economic approach can be applied to new industries such as software manufacturers, Internet service providers, and those that provide communications equipment and services. \"The antitrust laws are here to stay,\" Posner writes, \"and the practical question is how to administer them better-more rationally, more accurately, more expeditiously, more efficiently.\" This fully revised classic will continue to be the standard work in the field.","isbn10":"0226675769","average_rating":"4","categories":"Law","title":"Antitrust Law, Second Edition","ratings_count":"33","authors":"Richard A.

Desperate to dispose of the body before her husband comes home with an important foreign politician, Clarissa persuades her three house guests to become accessories and accomplices. It seems that the murdered man was not unknown to certain members of the house party (but which ones?), and the search begins for the murderer and the motive, while at the same time trying to persuade a police inspector that there has been no murder at all...

But Charlie\u0027s been lucky. He owns a building in the heart of San Francisco, and runs a secondhand store with the help of a couple of loyal, if marginally insane, employees. He\u0027s married to a bright and pretty woman who actually loves him for his normalcy. And she, Rachel, is about to have their first child. Yes, Charlie\u0027s doing okay for a Beta. That is, until the day his daughter, Sophie, is born. Just as Charlie -- exhausted from the birth -- turns to go home, he sees a strange man in mint-green golf wear at Rachel\u0027s hospital bedside, a man who claims that no one should be able to see him. But see him Charlie does, and from here on out, things get really weird. . . .

They bring alive her family and friends, her surroundings and contemporary events with a freshness unparalleled in modern biographies. Above all we recognize the unmistakable voice of the author of such novels as Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. We see the shift in her writing from witty and amusing descriptions of the social life of town and country, to a thoughtful and constructive tone while writing about the business of literary composition. R.W. Chapman\u0027s ground-breaking edition of the collected Letters first appeared in 1932, and a second edition followed twenty years later.

Originally published in Romanian in 1933, this semiautobiographical novel by the world renowned scholar Mircea Eliade details the passionate awakenings of Alain, an ambitious young French engineer flush with colonial pride and prejudice and full of a European fascination with the mysterious subcontinent. Offered the hospitality of a senior Indian colleague, Alain grasps at the chance to discover the authentic India firsthand. He soon finds himself enchanted by his host\u0027s daughter, the lovely and inscrutable Maitreyi, a precocious young poet and former student of Tagore. What follows is a charming, tentative flirtation that soon, against all the proprieties and precepts of Indian society, blossoms into a love affair both impossible and ultimately tragic. This erotic passion plays itself out in Alain\u0027s thoughts long after its bitter conclusion. In hindsight he sets down the story, quoting from the diaries of his disordered days, and trying to make sense of the sad affair. A vibrantly poetic love story, Bengal Nights is also a cruel account of the wreckage left in the wake of a young man\u0027s self discovery. At once horrifying and deeply moving, Eliade\u0027s story repeats the patterns of European engagement with India even as it exposes and condemns them. Invaluable for the insight it offers into Eliade\u0027s life and thought, it is a work of great intellectual and emotional power. \"Bengal Nights is forceful and harshly poignant, written with a great love of India informed by clear-eyed understanding. But do not open it if you prefer to remain unmoved by your reading matter. It is enough to make stones weep.\" — Literary Review Mircea Eliade (1907-1986) was the Sewell L. Avery Distinguished Service Professor in the Divinity School and the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. Many of his scholarly works, as well as his two-volume autobiography and four-volume journal, are published by the University of Chicago Press. Translated into French in 1950, Bengal Nights was an immediate critical success. The film, Les Nuits Bengali, appeared in 1987.","isbn10":"0226204197","average_rating":"393","categories":"Fiction","title":"Bengal Nights","ratings_count":"245","authors":"Mircea Eliade"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-377.7789001464844,"y":-196.36404418945312,"id":"649","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d0NW1swEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1986","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"839","isbn10":"0140093141","average_rating":"443","categories":"Autobiographical fiction","title":"I, Claudius and Claudius the God","ratings_count":"2422","authors":"Robert Graves"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":438.1033630371094,"y":137.03680419921875,"id":"1095","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d5WXe9lE-Ix8C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1998","isbn13":"9,78016E+12","num_pages":"314","description":"Living the innocent life of a proofreader, Raimundo Silva changes a key word in a history text that leads him to romance and alters the course of European history","isbn10":"0156006243","average_rating":"38","categories":"Fiction","title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","ratings_count":"324","authors":"José Saramago"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":324.9848327636719,"y":266.6842041015625,"id":"874","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dW9p21K45kkwC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"304","description":"Setting the record straight about her life as a novelist (less glitz and glamour than sitting alone in a darkened bedroom with a laptop in front of her) Marian Keyes here presents a selection of her articles.

Basbanes offers a lively consideration of writings that have \"made things happen\" in the world, works that have both nudged the course of history and fired the imagination of countless influential people. In his fifth work to examine a specific aspect of book culture, Basbanes also asks what we can know about such figures as John Milton, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Adams, Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, Henry James, Thomas Edison, Helen Keller––even the notorious Marquis de Sade and Adolf Hitler––by knowing what they have read. He shows how books that many of these people have consulted, in some cases annotated with their marginal notes, can offer tantalizing clues to the evolution of their character and the development of their thought.","isbn10":"0060593245","average_rating":"373","categories":"Literary Criticism","title":"Every Book Its Reader","ratings_count":"300","authors":"Nicholas A.

Journey Into God\u0027s Word helps Bible readers acquire these skills and become better at reading, interpreting, and applying the Bible to life. This abridgment of the bestselling college/seminary textbook Grasping God\u0027s Word takes the proven principles from that book and makes them accessible to people in the church. It starts with general principles of interpretation, then moves on to apply those principles to specific genres and contexts.

As a result of his famous ”double pincer” maneuver, 70,000 Roman soldiers died within the space of a few hours on a field the size of New York\u0027s Central Park. Yet, as devastating and startling as Cannae was, it was only one of a long list of incredible achievements. Hannibal\u0027s fantastic 1,000-mile march across the Alps from Spain to Italy was one of the wonders of ancient times. He began his hazardous journey with 90,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, and 37 elephants. By the time he reached the Valley of the Po, more than 30,000 troops and many of his elephants had perished, but he still managed to stay in Italy for sixteen years.Blending biography and military adventure, Hannibal is a portrait of a military genius who was also a highly civilized man. The son of Hamilcar Barca, a famous general in his own right, Hannibal was a student of the Greek classics. But his father\u0027s lifelong grudge against Rome fostered in the son a deep hatred for that Republic and a fierce determination to subdue it forever. This resulted in the bloody battles of Lake Trasimene, Campania, Nole, Capua, and Zama, all of which Leonard Cottrell describes with vigor and authority. In gathering material for Hannibal, Cottrell traveled the entire route that Hannibal took across the Alps, thus bringing to his account a valuable firsthand knowledge of his subject. With the drama and authenticity for which he is famous, Leonard Cottrell describes Hannibal\u0027s amazing campaign—a saga of victory after victory which fell just short of its ultimate goal: the annihilation of Rome.","isbn10":"0306804980","average_rating":"389","categories":"History","title":"Hannibal","ratings_count":"128","authors":"Leonard Cottrell"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-176.62466430664062,"y":374.144287109375,"id":"1528","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dn_7-8NXgl3EC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","num_pages":"448","description":"With the death of the Chairman of the Vampire Council and the rise of the seventh level of Hell, Damali is confronted by her ultimate challenge, a once banished entity with the power to stop a Neteru.

The result is one of the most explosive and controversial books of the year -- guaranteed to change the lives of men and transform the way women understand the opposite sex forever. On his journey from AFC (average frustrated chump) to PUA (pick-up artist) to PUG (pick-up guru), Strauss not only shares scores of original seduction techniques but also has unforgettable encounters with the likes of Tom Cruise, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Heidi Fleiss, and Courtney Love.

All proceed through a series of dramatic scenes to a climax that in one case at least is literally explosive. The fast-paced Miss or Mrs? (1871) opens on a yacht, features a remarkably unconventional heroine, and entails murder attempts, blackmail, clandestine marriage and commercial fraud. Dramatic and psychologically absorbing, the action of The Haunted Hotel (1878) takes place in an ancient Venetian palazzo converted into a modern hotel that houses a grisly secreI. Lastly, set in a beautiful water-mill, The Guilty River (1886) depicts a group of alienated characters, whose relationships threaten to erupt in violence and murder. Varied in setting and tone, these stories demonstrate Collins\u0027s plot-making skill at its most succinct and intricate. *Introduction * Textual Note * Bibliography * Chronology * * Explanatory Notes *Appendix: Collins\u0027s prefaces","isbn10":"0192833073","average_rating":"379","categories":"Fiction","title":"Miss Or Mrs?","ratings_count":"170","authors":"Wilkie Collins"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":272.9411315917969,"y":-142.01019287109375,"id":"1443","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dyo8USz2i7RIC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"Five Perspectives","num_pages":"272","description":"A feisty, entertaining, and educational conversation about the shape of the church of the 21st century.","isbn10":"0310254876","average_rating":"335","categories":"Religion","title":"The Church in Emerging Culture","ratings_count":"188","authors":"Andy Crouch"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-309.01416015625,"y":291.4046630859375,"id":"612","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dP4-i_eBBhL8C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,7801E+12","num_pages":"722","description":"It began with Benny Hogan and Eve Malone, growing up, inseparable, in the village of Knockglen.

In Linda Lear\u0027s enchanting new biography, we get the life story of this incredible, funny, and independent woman. As one of the first female naturalists in the world, Potter brought the beauty and importance of nature back into the imagination at a time when plunder was more popular than preservation.

This is the first major history of Europe to give equal weight to both East and West, and it shines light on fascinating minority communities, from heretics and lepers to Gypsies, Jews, and Muslims. It also takes an innovative approach, combining traditional narrative with unique features that help bring history alive: 299 time capsules scattered through the narrative capture telling aspects of an era. 12 -snapshots offer a panoramic look at all of Europe at a particular moment in history.

It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about visionary companies.\" So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time. Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: \"What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?\" What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter \u0026 Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world\u0027s best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked? By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies. Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.","isbn10":"0060566108","average_rating":"373","categories":"Business \u0026 Economics","title":"Built to Last","ratings_count":"49529","authors":"Jim Collins;Jerry I.

Bleak tools of the cold war, they embodied the rigid organization and mechanical conformity that made the military-industrial complex possible. But by the 1990s—and the dawn of the Internet—computers started to represent a very different kind of world: a collaborative and digital utopia modeled on the communal ideals of the hippies who so vehemently rebelled against the cold war establishment in the first place. From Counterculture to Cyberculture is the first book to explore this extraordinary and ironic transformation. Fred Turner here traces the previously untold story of a highly influential group of San Francisco Bay–area entrepreneurs: Stewart Brand and the Whole Earth network. Between 1968 and 1998, via such familiar venues as the National Book Award–winning Whole Earth Catalog, the computer conferencing system known as WELL, and, ultimately, the launch of the wildly successful Wired magazine, Brand and his colleagues brokered a long-running collaboration between San Francisco flower power and the emerging technological hub of Silicon Valley. Thanks to their vision, counterculturalists and technologists alike joined together to reimagine computers as tools for personal liberation, the building of virtual and decidedly alternative communities, and the exploration of bold new social frontiers. Shedding new light on how our networked culture came to be, this fascinating book reminds us that the distance between the Grateful Dead and Google, between Ken Kesey and the computer itself, is not as great as we might think.","isbn10":"0226817415","average_rating":"396","categories":"Social Science","title":"From Counterculture to Cyberculture","ratings_count":"323","authors":"Fred Turner"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-215.26629638671875,"y":305.45343017578125,"id":"1530","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dSaqfl3hXqfEC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"A Novel","num_pages":"336","description":"Based on the Book of Genesis, Dinah shares her perspective on religous practices and sexul politics.","isbn10":"0312353766","average_rating":"417","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Red Tent","ratings_count":"453899","authors":"Anita Diamant"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-452.2442626953125,"y":363.95635986328125,"id":"456","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d00d_C6Yf9m0C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2009","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","subtitle":"A Treasury of More than 1000 Quotations","description":"An extremely entertaining compendium of bon mots, anecdotes, and trivia about Winston Churchill from a leading Churchill lecturer and performer -- useful for speakers, students, of history, and World War II buffs, as well as general readers.","isbn10":"006183307X","categories":"History","title":"The Wit and Wisdom of Winston Churchill","authors":"James C.

For Deleuze, Nietzsche challenged conventional philosophical ideas and provided a means of escape from Hegel\u0027s dialectical thinking, which had come to dominate French philosophy. He also offered a path toward a politics of difference.

From his contributions to the development of the atomic bomb a Los Alamos during World War II to his work in quantum electrodynamics, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965, Feynman was celebrated for his brilliant and irreverent approach to physics.It was Feynman\u0027s outrageous and scintillating method of teaching that earned him legendary status among students and professors of physics. From 1961–1963, Feynman, at the California Institute of Technology, delivered a series of lectures that revolutionized the teaching of physics around the world. Six Easy Pieces, taken from the famous Lectures on Physics, represents the most accessible material from this series. In these six chapters, Feynman introduces the general reader to the following topics: atoms, basic physics, the relationship of physics to other topics, energy, gravitation, and quantum force. With his dazzling and inimitable wit, Feynman presents each discussion without equations or technical jargon.Readers will remember how—using ice water and rubber—Feynman demonstrated with stunning simplicity to a nationally televised audience the physics of the 1986 Challenger disaster. It is precisely this ability—the clear and direct illustration of complex theories—that made Richard Feynman one of the most distinguished educators in the world. Filled with wonderful examples and clever illustrations, Six Easy Pieces is the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics by one of the most admired and accessible scientists of our time.","isbn10":"0201408252","average_rating":"42","categories":"Science","title":"Six Easy Pieces","ratings_count":"160","authors":"Richard P.

On the occasion of the Centennial of the University of Chicago and its Press, we take pleasure in reissuing this complete work in a handsome four-volume slipcased edition as well as in redesigned versions of the familiar paperbacks. For the Centennial Edition two of the original translations have been replaced. In the original publication David Grene translated only one of the three Theban plays, Oedipus the King. Now he has added his own translations of the remaining two, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, thus bringing a new unity of tone and style to this group. Grene has also revised his earlier translation of Prometheus Bound and rendered some of the former prose sections in verse. These new translations replace the originals included in the paperback volumes Sophocles I (which contains all three Theban plays), Aeschylus II, Greek Tragedies, Volume I, and Greek Tragedies, Volume III, all of which are now being published in second editions. All other volumes contain the translations of the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides for the most part from the original versions first published in the 1940s and 1950s. These translations have been the choice of generations of teachers and students, selling in the past forty years over three million copies.","isbn10":"0226307654","average_rating":"414","categories":"Drama","title":"Greek tragedies","ratings_count":"33","authors":"Sophocles;Aeschylus;Euripides"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-184.60748291015625,"y":-70.52902221679688,"id":"384","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dU6zjwAEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1992","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"352","description":"In the spring of 1914, renowned photographer August Sander took a photograph of three young men on their way to a country dance.

The audacity of this novel seemed to me to be liberating rather than provocative. I perceived the promise of a new freedom. And I expected to cause a shock.\"--Jean-Jacques Pauvert, from the Introduction When Story of O was first published in 1954 in Paris by Jean-Jacques Pauvert, it narrowly escaped censorship by the Department of the Interior and eventually became the most widely translated French novel in the world. It describes in cool, elegant language the experiences of a young woman as she willingly enters a dark maze of perverse sexual practices within a clandestine amoral society. Revelling in pure fantasy, its theme is total submission through love to excesses of sadism and masochism, and the bond of \"ownership.\" Now Doris Kloster, a photographer specializing in issues of women\u0027s sexuality and power, has realized a long-standing dream. She has created a photographic representation of one of the most famous and controversial erotic novels ever published. The result is another sensation. The Illustrated Story of O presents over 50 superb images which mirror perfectly the intense eroticism of the novel. Shooting entirely in Paris and its environs, Doris Kloster has succeeded in matching characters, locations, costumes and props to the original descriptions. And each magnificent color photograph is accompanied by a short extract from the novel. In addition, there is a Preface from Doris Kloster herself and an Introduction from Jean-Jacques Pauvert, the original publisher of the novel. The Illustrated Story of O presents a rich visual feast that will delight fans of Doris Kloster\u0027s work, and appeal strongly to connoisseurs of the darker excesses of sexuality. It is destined to become a classic collector\u0027s edition.","isbn10":"0312266057","average_rating":"4","categories":"Photography","title":"The Illustrated Story Of O","ratings_count":"25","authors":"Pauline Reage"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-307.3693542480469,"y":213.27764892578125,"id":"1602","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dOiTxAXtNetwC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2007","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","num_pages":"391","description":"The three magically talented Fortune sisters--Dee, a shape-shifter; Lizzie, who possesses the power to transform objects; and telekinetic Mare--find love with three seductive and unusual men, while struggling to cope with a villain who will do anything to steal their magical gifts, in a novel by three popular romance novelists.

You may not know it, but you\u0027ve met Augusten Burroughs. You\u0027ve seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twenty-something guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had to drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls, and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn\u0027t really a request) of his employers, Augusten landed in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey, Jr., are immediately dashed by the grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click, and that\u0027s when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life—and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that\u0027s as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is real. Dry is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a higher power.","isbn10":"0312423799","average_rating":"402","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Dry","ratings_count":"75017","authors":"Augusten Burroughs"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-314.9743957519531,"y":-439.67266845703125,"id":"1594","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dPoiDzEZ6P1cC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","num_pages":"347","description":"Beaumont, South Carolina, has become a hotbed of problems for pediatrician Maggie Farnsworth, when her former boyfriend, an escaped convict, arrives in search of Maggie and her young daughter, with handsome FBI agent Zack Madden in hot pursuit, while the other inhabitants of the town are also enjoying their own brushes with romance.

Nikki self–published her first book Black Feeling, Black Talk/BlackJudgement in 1969, selling 10,000 copies; William Morrow published in 1970. Know for its iconic revolutionary phrases, it is heralded as one of the most important volumes of modern African–American poetry and is considered the seminal volume of Nikki\u0027s body of work. My House (Morrow 1972) marks a new dimension in tone and philosphy––This is Giovanni\u0027s first foray into the autobiographical. In The Women and the Men (Morrow 1975), Nikki displays her compassion for the people, things and places she has encountered––She reveres the ordinary and is in search of the extraordinary. Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day (Morrow 1978) is one of the most poignant and introspective of all Giovanni\u0027s collections. These poems chronicle the drastic change that took place during the 1970s––when the dreams of the Civil Rights era seemed to have evaporated.

In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren\u0027t as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren\u0027t those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.","isbn10":"0316172324","average_rating":"392","categories":"Business \u0026 Economics","title":"Blink","ratings_count":"4089","authors":"Malcolm Gladwell"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":257.6472473144531,"y":-317.713623046875,"id":"1035","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d-pOd81IGgmUC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"280","description":"In a story inspired by the father character in Little Women and drawn from the journals and letters of Louisa May Alcott\u0027s father Bronson, a man leaves behind his family to serve in the Civil War and finds his marriage and beliefs profoundly challenged by his experiences.

This edition of Oscar Wilde\u0027s classic work, The Picture of Dorian Gray, highlights the novel\u0027s modernity in both its form and its revolutionary content, and traces its links to modernist literature and the culture of modernity alike. Previous editions of the novel have only seen it in a late Victorian context, or as an extension of the aesthetic theories of Walter Pater and the \"art for art\u0027s sake\" movement. As presented in this new edition, however, the freshness and originality of the book emerges, along with its strong social messages. The book is a pastiche of genres that propels nineteenth-century realism into twentieth-century modernism ahead of its own time. Wilde\u0027s novel offers a myth for modernity whose hold on the cultural imagination has only strengthened over time-Dorian Gray\u0027s uncanny bond with his own portrait underscores the loss of selfhood everyone experiences in a world of images and copies, paves the way for the discourses of homosexuality and the understanding of lifestyle as identity so current today, and provides clues to the mysteries of modern ethics and politics. The edition also emphasizes the role of gender and the rise of female emancipation underlying the Sybil Vane subplot, a focus on women that intensifies the book\u0027s relevance to modern transformations of men and women alike.","isbn10":"0321427130","average_rating":"407","categories":"Fiction","title":"Oscar Wilde\u0027s The Picture of Dorian Gray","ratings_count":"119","authors":"Oscar Wilde;Andrew Elfenbein"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-437.72625732421875,"y":-63.11627197265625,"id":"657","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dZBptQgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1991","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"And Other Tales of Psychotherapy","num_pages":"270","description":"Contains eight case-studies of people the author has treated, including a woman of 67, obsessively pining with love for her 32-year-old previous therapist and a woman of 19 stone who has emotional difficulties because of her weight problem.

Situating Jefferson within the context of America\u0027s evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years, Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it. Conflicted by power, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America\u0027s development, this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer, he was an awkward public speaker; a reluctant candidate, he left an indelible presidential legacy. Jefferson\u0027s statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France, doubling the size of the nation, and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition, opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jefferson\u0027s handling of the Barbary War, a lesser-known chapter of his political career, when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states, and the subsequent war with Tripoli, led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of America\u0027s reputation regarding national defense. In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama: the fledgling nation\u0027s struggle for independence, formed in the crucible of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and, in its shadow, the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution. This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in American history -- or in the ambiguities of human nature.","isbn10":"0060598964","average_rating":"373","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"Thomas Jefferson","ratings_count":"2181","authors":"Christopher Hitchens"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-203.3206787109375,"y":61.06671142578125,"id":"588","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dHVWEDUYM-YUC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,7801E+12","num_pages":"384","description":"The cream of British and American crime writers combine for a must- have collection of linked short stories- With each writer picking up the story in their usual locale (Val McDermid in Manchester, Denise Mina in Glasgow, Karin Slaughter in Atlanta), each of these prestigious crime writers tells a gripping story (original to this collection) of murder, betrayal and intrigue.

Rich with information including details from new archival material and written with the nail-biting suspense of a modern thriller, The Last Days of Henry VIII offers a superb fresh look at this fascinating figure and new insight into an intriguing chapter in history. Robert Hutchinson paints a brilliant portrait of this egotistical tyrant who governed with a ruthlessness that rivals that of modern dictators; a monarch who had \"no respect or fear of anyone in this world,\" according to the Spanish ambassador to his court. Henry VIII pioneered the modern \"show trial\": cynical propaganda exercises in which the victims were condemned before the proceedings even opened, proving the most powerful men in the land could be brought down overnight. After thirty-five years in power, Henry was a bloated, hideously obese, black-humored old recluse. And despite his having had six wives, the Tudor dynasty rested on the slight shoulders of his only male heir, the nine-year-old Prince Edward -- a situation that spurred rival factions into a deadly conflict to control the throne. The Last Days of Henry VIII is a gripping and compelling history as fascinating and remarkable as its subject.","isbn10":"0060837330","average_rating":"373","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII","ratings_count":"1460","authors":"Robert Hutchinson"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":252.30184936523438,"y":-381.62750244140625,"id":"802","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d-TCOs_SFAy0C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1970","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"174","description":"The Agricola is both a portrait of Julius Agricola – the most famous governor of Roman Britain and Tacitus\u0027 well-loved and respected father-in-law – and the first detailed account of Britain that has come down to us.

Considered a prodigy in scientific research, he surprised everyone and himself by setting his sights on the competitive world of high finance. Yet no sooner had he landed an entry-level position at a prestigious firm than Gardner found himself caught in a web of incredibly challenging circumstances that left him as part of the city\u0027s working homeless and with a toddler son. Motivated by the promise he made to himself as a fatherless child to never abandon his own children, the two spent almost a year moving among shelters, \"HO-tels,\" soup lines, and even sleeping in the public restroom of a subway station. Never giving in to despair, Gardner made an astonishing transformation from being part of the city\u0027s invisible poor to being a powerful player in its financial district. More than a memoir of Gardner\u0027s financial success, this is the story of a man who breaks his own family\u0027s cycle of men abandoning their children.

Although these women are part of a modernizing middle class, they also voluntarily adopt a traditional symbol of female subordination. How can this paradox be explained? An explanation emerges which reconceptualizes what appears to be reactionary behavior as a new style of political struggle--as accommodating protest. These women, most of them clerical workers in the large government bureaucracy, are ambivalent about working outside the home, considering it a change which brings new burdens as well as some important benefits. At the same time they realize that leaving home and family is creating an intolerable situation of the erosion of their social status and the loss of their traditional identity. The new veiling expresses women\u0027s protest against this. MacLeod argues that the symbolism of the new veiling emerges from this tense subcultural dilemma, involving elements of both resistance and acquiescence.","isbn10":"023112189X","average_rating":"396","categories":"Literary Criticism","title":"William Faulkner","ratings_count":"4","authors":"Nicolas Tredell"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-305.9801330566406,"y":271.72869873046875,"id":"1345","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dE5bj1XDvRxUC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2001","isbn13":"9,78025E+12","num_pages":"248","description":"Why Are Ethical Issues Central to Documentary Filmmaking? - How Do Documentaries Differ from Other Types of Film? - What Gives Documentary Films a Voice of Their Own? - What Are Documentaries About? - How Did Documentary Filmmaking Get Started? - What Types of Documentary Are There? - How Have documentaries Addressed Social and Political Issues? - How Can We Write Effectively about Documentary?","isbn10":"0253214696","average_rating":"377","categories":"Performing Arts","title":"Introduction to Documentary","ratings_count":"194","authors":"Bill Nichols"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-66.47439575195312,"y":-290.2341003417969,"id":"1513","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d93Q0Q1bjH3AC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","subtitle":"A Memoir","num_pages":"192","description":"An Oxford scholar and author of The Truth About the Irish candidly recounts his experiences as an impoverished youth, a convent gatekeeper, a Catholic in Protestant England, a working-class Irish immigrant among the Oxbridge elite, and a Marxist visiting professor in Mormon Utah.

Impeccably researched, filled with page-turning romance, passion, and scandal, Sex with the Queen explores the scintillating sexual lives of some of our most beloved and infamous female rulers. She was the queen, living in an opulent palace, wearing lavish gowns and dazzling jewels. She was envied, admired, and revered. She was also miserable, having been forced to marry a foreign prince sight unseen, a royal ogre who was sadistic, foaming at the mouth, physically repulsive, mentally incompetent, or sexually impotent—and in some cases all of the above. How did queens find happiness? In courts bristling with testosterone—swashbuckling generals, polished courtiers, and virile cardinals—many royal women had love affairs. Anne Boleyn flirted with courtiers; Catherine Howard slept with one. Henry VIII had both of them beheaded. Catherine the Great had her idiot husband murdered, and ruled the Russian empire with a long list of sexy young favorites. Marie Antoinette fell in love with the handsome Swedish count Axel Fersen, who tried valiantly to rescue her from the guillotine. Empress Alexandra of Russia found emotional solace in the mad monk Rasputin. Her behavior was the spark that set off the firestorm of the Russian revolution. Princess Diana gave up her palace bodyguard to enjoy countless love affairs, which tragically led to her early death. When a queen became sick to death of her husband and took a lover, anything could happen—from disgrace and death to political victory. Some kings imprisoned erring wives for life; other monarchs obligingly named the queen\u0027s lover prime minister. The crucial factor deciding the fate of an unfaithful queen was the love affair\u0027s implications in terms of power, money, and factional rivalry. At European courts, it was the politics—not the sex—that caused a royal woman\u0027s tragedy—or her ultimate triumph.","isbn10":"0060846739","average_rating":"373","categories":"History","title":"Sex with the Queen","ratings_count":"3676","authors":"Eleanor Herman"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":403.6309509277344,"y":-416.48297119140625,"id":"1215","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d-l1D5bJ4K3UC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1998","isbn13":"9,78019E+12","subtitle":"A Novel in Verse","num_pages":"240","description":"Eugene Onegin is the master work of the poet whom Russians regard as the fountainhead of their literature.

Eugene Onegin was Pushkin\u0027s own favourite work, and it shows him attempting to transform himself from a romantic poet into a realistic novelist. This new translation seeks to retain both the literal sense and the poetic music of the original, and capture the poem\u0027s spontaneity and wit. The introduction examines several ways of reading the novel, and text is richly annotated. -","isbn10":"0192838997","average_rating":"409","categories":"Fiction","title":"Eugene Onegin","ratings_count":"39511","authors":"Alexander Pushkin;James E.

His first book, It\u0027s Not About the Bike, charted his journey back to life and went on to become an international bestseller. Now, in his much-anticipated follow-up, Armstrong shares more details of his extraordinary life story, including the births of his twin daughters Grace and Isabel. Never shy of controversy, Armstrong offers, with typical frankness, his thoughts on training, competing, winning and failure. He also tells of the work he did for the foundation he created following his dramatic recovery, addresses the daunting challenge of living in the aftermath of cancer and treatment, and shares further inspirational tales of survival. A fresh outlook on the spirit of survivors everywhere, Every Second Counts is an account of a man who strives every day to meet life\u0027s challenges - whether on his bike or off. Every Second Counts was first published in October 2003. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in January 2013, Lance Armstrong admitted to having taken performance enhancing drugs in all seven of the Tours de France in which he competed between 1999 and 2005. He was officially stripped of these wins by the UCI, the world governing body for cycling, in 2012.","isbn10":"0224064738","average_rating":"352","categories":"Cancer","title":"Every Second Counts","ratings_count":"270","authors":"Lance Armstrong;Sally Jenkins"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":18.97336196899414,"y":-403.55908203125,"id":"1310","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dD6p-mttXlAEC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1981","isbn13":"9,78023E+12","subtitle":"Gustave Flaubert, 1821-1857","num_pages":"632","description":"With this volume, the University of Chicago Press completes its translation of a work that is indispensable not only to serious readers of Flaubert but to anyone interested in the last major contribution by one of the twentieth century\u0027s greatest thinkers. That Sartre\u0027s study of Flaubert, The Family Idiot, is a towering achievement in intellectual history has never been disputed. Yet critics have argued about the precise nature of this novel or biography or \"criticism-fiction\" which is the summation of Sartre\u0027s philosophical, social, and literary thought. In the preface, Sartre writes: \"The Family Idiot is the sequel to Search for a Method. The subject: what, at this point in time, can we know about a man? It seemed to me that this question could only be answered by studying a specific case.\" Sartre discusses Flaubert\u0027s personal development, his relationship to his family, his decision to become a writer, and the psychosomatic crisis or \"conversion\" from his father\u0027s domination to the freedom of his art. Sartre blends psychoanalysis with a sociological study of the ideology of the period, the crisis in literature, and Flaubert\u0027s influence on the future of literature. While Sartre never wrote the final volume he envisioned for this vast project, the existing volumes constitute in themselves a unified work—one that John Sturrock, writing in the Observer, called \"a shatteringly fertile, digressive and ruthless interpretation of these few cardinal years in Flaubert\u0027s life.\" \"A virtuoso perfomance. . . . For all that this book does to make one reconsider his life, The Family Idiot is less a case study of Flaubert than it is a final installment of Sartre\u0027s mythology. . . . The translator, Carol Cosman, has acquitted herself brilliantly.\"—Frederick Brown, New York Review of Books \"A splendid translation by Carol Cosman. . . . Sartre called The Family Idiot a \u0027true novel,\u0027 and it does tell a story and eventually reach a shattering climax. The work can be described most simply as a dialectic, which shifts between two seemingly alternative interpretations of Flaubert\u0027s destiny: a psychoanalytic one, centered on his family and on his childhood, and a Marxist one, whose guiding themes are the status of the artist in Flaubert\u0027s period and the historical and ideological contradictions faced by his social class, the bourgeoisie.\"—Fredric Jameson, New York Times Book Review Jean-Paul Sartre (1906-1980) was offered, but declined, the Nobel Prize for literature in 1964. His many works of fiction, drama, and philosophy include the monumental study of Flaubert, The Family Idiot, and The Freud Scenario, both published in translation by the University of Chicago Press.","isbn10":"0226735192","average_rating":"38","categories":"Biography \u0026 Autobiography","title":"The Family Idiot","ratings_count":"5","authors":"Jean-Paul Sartre"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-286.4759826660156,"y":-282.122314453125,"id":"1575","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d_Zu4Su4cdMoC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1999","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","num_pages":"300","description":"A romantic tale follows a space swashbuckler and conman as he travels from world to world, plying his trade, drinking in wild bars, and flirting with women","isbn10":"0312864744","average_rating":"353","categories":"Fiction","title":"Ports of Call","ratings_count":"395","authors":"Jack Vance"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":116.45236206054688,"y":-463.5829162597656,"id":"786","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dTeOwd7KTsxgC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2000","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"272","description":"Portrays the brutal effects of the poverty and loneliness of slum life.","isbn10":"0140437975","average_rating":"366","categories":"Fiction","title":"Maggie, a Girl of the Streets, and Other Tales of New York","ratings_count":"2405","authors":"Stephen Crane"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":393.4407653808594,"y":-402.44580078125,"id":"1104","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dCy_6QwAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78016E+12","num_pages":"400","description":"New English versions of Lysistrata, The Frogs, The Birds, and Ladies\u0027 Day. \"Thanks to Dudley Fitts...we can appreciate Aristophanes\u0027 vigor, his robust style, his scorching wit, his earthy humor, his devotion to honesty and his poetic imagination\" (Brooks Atkinson, New York Times).

In Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns, highly acclaimed poet and translator Daryl Hine brings to life the words of Hesiod and the world of Archaic Greece. While most available versions of these early Greek writings are rendered in prose, Hine\u0027s illuminating translations represent these early classics as they originally appeared, in verse. Since prose was not invented as a literary medium until well after Hesiod\u0027s time, presenting these works as poems more closely approximates not only the mechanics but also the melody of the originals. This volume includes Hesiod\u0027s Works and Days and Theogony, two of the oldest non-Homeric poems to survive from antiquity. Works and Days is in part a farmer\u0027s almanac—filled with cautionary tales and advice for managing harvests and maintaining a good work ethic—and Theogony is the earliest comprehensive account of classical mythology—including the names and genealogies of the gods (and giants and monsters) of Olympus, the sea, and the underworld. Hine brings out Hesiod\u0027s unmistakable personality; Hesiod\u0027s tales of his escapades and his gritty and persuasive voice not only give us a sense of the author\u0027s own character but also offer up a rare glimpse of the everyday life of ordinary people in the eighth century BCE. In contrast, the Homeric Hymns are more distant in that they depict aristocratic life in a polished tone that reveals nothing of the narrators\u0027 personalities. These hymns (so named because they address the deities in short invocations at the beginning and end of each) are some of the earliest examples of epyllia, or short stories in the epic manner in Greek. This volume unites Hine\u0027s skillful translations of the Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns—along with Hine\u0027s rendering of the mock-Homeric epic The Battle of the Frogs and the Mice—in a stunning pairing of these masterful classics.","isbn10":"0226329658","average_rating":"372","categories":"Poetry","title":"Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns","ratings_count":"32","authors":"Hesiod"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":231.43154907226562,"y":-199.8321533203125,"id":"1041","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dtGNdrjM7NtwC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","subtitle":"A Nursery Crime","num_pages":"383","description":"Unconvinced that a former convict and millionaire philanthropist has been murdered by his suicide-victim ex-wife, detective inspector Jack Spratt and his assistant, Mary Mary, uncover a plot involving money laundering and asylum-seeking titans.","isbn10":"0143037234","average_rating":"393","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Big Over Easy","ratings_count":"26532","authors":"Jasper Fforde"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-350.756591796875,"y":112.34527587890625,"id":"443","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dNE-vsBpIuQ0C\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"388","description":"One of the most acclaimed novels in recent memory, The Known World is a daring and ambitious work by Pulitzer Prize winner Edward P.

Reading the Bible Again for the First Time provides a much-needed solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet contemporary understanding of the scriptures. Many mistakenly believe there are no choices other than fundamentalism or simply rejecting the Bible as something that can bring meaning to our lives. Answering this modern dilemma, acclaimed author Marcus Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile the Bible with both a scientific and critical way of thinking and our deepest spiritual needs, leading to a contemporary yet grounded experience of the sacred texts. This seminal book shows you how to read the Bible as it should be examined—in an approach the author calls \"historical-metaphorical.\" Borg explores what the Scriptures meant to the ancient communities that produced and lived by them. He then helps us to discover the meaning of these stories, providing the knowledge and perspective to make the wisdom of the Bible an essential part of our modern lives. The author argues that the conventional way of seeing the Bible\u0027s origin, authority, and interpretation has become unpersuasive to millions of people in our time, and that we need a fresh way of encountering the Bible that takes the texts seriously but not literally, even as it takes seriously who we have become. Borg traces his personal spiritual journey, describing for readers how he moved from an unquestioning childhood belief in the biblical stories to a more powerful and dynamic relationship with the Bible as a sacred text brimming with meaning and guidance. Using his own experience as an example, he reveals how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in the misinterpretation of sacred texts as historical record and divine dictation, and opens readers to a truer, more abundant perspective. This unique book invites everyone—whatever one\u0027s religious background—to engage the Bible, wrestle with its meaning, explore its mysteries, and understand its relevance. Borg shows us how to encounter the Bible in a fresh way that rejects the limits of simple literalism and opens up rich possibilities for our lives.","isbn10":"0060609192","average_rating":"373","categories":"Religion","title":"Reading the Bible Again for the First Time","ratings_count":"2875","authors":"Marcus J.

The trial and condemnation of Socrates on charges of heresy and corrupting young minds is a defining moment in the history of Classical Athens. In tracing these events through four dialogues, Plato also developed his own philosophy, based on Socrates\u0027 manifesto for a life guided by self-responsibility. Euthyphro finds Socrates outside the court-house, debating the nature of piety, while the Apology is his robust rebuttal of the charges of impiety and a defence of the philosopher\u0027s life. In the Crito, while awaiting execution in prison, Socrates counters the arguments of friends urging him to escape. Finally, in the Phaedo, he is shown calmly confident in the face of death, skilfully arguing the case for the immortality of the soul. Hugh Tredennick\u0027s landmark 1954 translation has been revised by Harold Tarrant, reflecting changes in Platonic studies, with an introduction and expanded introductions to each of the four dialogues. Plato (c.427-347 BC) stands with Socrates and Aristotle as one of the shapers of the whole intellectual tradition of the West. He founded the Academy in Athens, the first permanent institution devoted to philosophical research and teaching, and the prototype of all Western universities.

An engaging mix of philosophy, history, biography, and literary detection, Wittgenstein\u0027s Poker explores, through the Popper/Wittgenstein confrontation, the history of philosophy in the twentieth century. It evokes the tumult of fin-de-siécle Vienna, Wittgentein\u0027s and Popper\u0027s birthplace; the tragedy of the Nazi takeover of Austria; and postwar Cambridge University, with its eccentric set of philosophy dons, including Bertrand Russell.

Until the morning she wakes up in her mammy\u0027s living room in Dublin with stitches in her face, a dislocated knee, and completely smashed-up hands -- and no memory of how she got there.

Recuperating from her injuries, a mystified Anna returns to Manhattan.

Originally published in 1994 -- and never before available in the United States -- Sleep, Pale Sister is a hypnotically atmospheric story set in nineteenth century London. When puritanical artist Henry Chester sees delicate child beauty Effie, he makes her his favorite model and, before long, his bride. But Henry, volatile and repressed, is in love with an ideal. Passive, docile, and asexual, the woman he projects onto Effie is far from the woman she really is. And when Effie begins to discover the murderous depths of Henry\u0027s hypocrisy, her latent passion will rise to the surface. Sleep, Pale Sister combines the ethereal beauty of a Pre-Raphaelite painting with a chilling high gothic tale and is a testament to Harris\u0027s brimming cornucopia of talents. This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.","isbn10":"0061843180","categories":"Fiction","title":"Sleep, Pale Sister","authors":"Joanne Harris"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":473.8890075683594,"y":-309.7147216796875,"id":"958","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d6WdfQgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"376","description":"What really happened to Miss Quested in the Marabar Caves?

Frey, author of the internationally best-selling books on the craft of writing, How to Write a Damn Good Novel, How to Write a Damn Good Novel II: Advanced Techniques, and The Key: How to Write Damn Good Fiction Using the Power of Myth, has now written what is certain to become the standard \"how to\" book for mystery writing, How to Write a Damn Good Mystery. Frey urges writers to aim high-not to try to write a good-enough-to-get-published mystery, but a damn good mystery. A damn good mystery is first a dramatic novel, Frey insists-a dramatic novel with living, breathing characters-and he shows his readers how to create a living, breathing, believable character who will be clever and resourceful, willful and resolute, and will be what Frey calls \"the author of the plot behind the plot.\" Frey then shows, in his well-known, entertaining, and accessible (and often humorous) style , how the characters-the entire ensemble, including the murderer, the detective, the authorities, the victims, the suspects, the witnesses and the bystanders-create a complete and coherent world. Exploring both the on-stage action and the behind-the-scenes intrigue, Frey shows prospective writers how to build a fleshed-out, believable, and logical world. He shows them exactly which parts of that world show up in the pages of a damn good mystery-and which parts are held back just long enough to keep the reader guessing. This is an indispensable step-by-step guide for anyone who\u0027s ever dreamed of writing a damn good mystery.","isbn10":"0312304463","average_rating":"397","categories":"Language Arts \u0026 Disciplines","title":"How to Write a Damn Good Mystery","ratings_count":"305","authors":"James N.

Will human genetic engineering become commonplace? Will human cloning ever be safe? Are there many universes? How much will the climate change during the coming century? The Best American Science Writing 2002 gathers top writers and scientists covering the latest developments in the fastest-changing, farthest-reaching scientific fields, such as medicine, genetics, computer technology, evolutionary psychology, cutting-edge physics, and the environment. Among this year\u0027s selections: In \"The Made-to-Order Savior,\" Lisa Belkin spotlights two desperate families seeking an unprecedented cure by a medically and ethically unprecedented means -- creating a genetically matched child. Margaret Talbot\u0027s \"A Desire to Duplicate\" reveals that the first human clone may very likely come from an entirely unexpected source, and sooner than we think. Michael Specter reports on the shock waves rippling through the field of neuroscience following the revolutionary discovery that adult brain cells might in fact regenerate (\"Rethinking the Brain\"). Christopher Dickey\u0027s \"I Love My Glow Bunny\" recounts with sly humor a peculiar episode in which genetic engineering and artistic culture collide. Natalie Angier draws an insightful contrast between suicide terrorists and rescue workers who risk their lives, and finds that sympathy and altruism have a definite place in the evolution of human nature, David Berlinski\u0027s \"What Brings a World into Being?\" ponders the idea of biology and physics as essentially digital technologies, exploring the mysteries encoded in the universe\u0027s smallest units, be they cells or quanta. Nicholas Wade shows how one of the most controversial books of the year, The Skeptical Environmentalist, by former Greenpeace member and self-described leftist Bjorn Lomborg, debunks some of the most cherished tenets of the environmental movement, suggesting that things are perhaps not as bad as we\u0027ve been led to believe. And as a counterpoint, Darcy Frey\u0027s profile of George Divoky reveals a dedicated researcher whose love of birds and mystery leads to some sobering discoveries about global warming and forcefully reminds us of the unsung heroes of science: those who put in long hours, fill in small details, and take great trouble. In the end, the unanswered questions are what sustain scientific inquiry, open new frontiers of knowledge, and lead to new technologies and medical treatments. The Best American Science Writing 2002 is a series of exciting reports from science\u0027s front lines, where what we don\u0027t know is every bit as important as what we know.","isbn10":"0060936509","average_rating":"373","categories":"Science","title":"The Best American Science Writing 2002","ratings_count":"66","authors":"Matt Ridley;Alan Lightman"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":434.7403259277344,"y":119.5601806640625,"id":"1662","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003drnDHlgEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2003","isbn13":"9,78032E+12","subtitle":"The Last Coyote, Trunk Music, Angels Flight","num_pages":"821","description":"The Last Coyote: LAPD homicide detective Harry Bosch is suspended from the force for attacking his commanding officer.

Beauty is a gentle but urgent call to awaken. Bestselling author John O\u0027Donohue opens our eyes, hearts, and minds to the wonder of our own relationship with beauty by exposing the infinity and mystery of its breadth. His words return us to the dignity of silence, profundity of stillness, power of thought and perception, and the eternal grace and generosity of beauty\u0027s presence. In this masterful and revelatory work, O\u0027Donohue encourages our greater intimacy with beauty and celebrates it for what it really is: a homecoming of the human spirit. As he focuses on the classical, medieval, and Celtic traditions of art, music, literature, nature, and language, O\u0027Donohue reveals how beauty\u0027s invisible embrace invites us toward new heights of passion and creativity even in these uncertain times of global conflict and crisis.","isbn10":"0060957263","average_rating":"373","categories":"Body, Mind \u0026 Spirit","title":"Beauty","ratings_count":"622","authors":"John O\u0027Donohue"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-387.3851623535156,"y":-267.0715637207031,"id":"1080","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003drhhKvgAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78015E+12","num_pages":"240","description":"In 1520, thirteen-year-old Anne Boleyn, jealous of her older sister\u0027s beauty and position at court, declares that she will one day be queen of England, and that her sister will kneel at her feet.","isbn10":"0152050868","average_rating":"387","categories":"Juvenile Fiction","title":"Doomed Queen Anne","ratings_count":"3478","authors":"Carolyn Meyer"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":446.4972229003906,"y":322.33197021484375,"id":"1745","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dTR1hHAAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1997","isbn13":"9,78034E+12","num_pages":"320","description":"Flatmates Fiona, Kerry and Linzi have problems enough squabbling over the itemised phone bill and whose turn it is to do the washing up.

Meet Zorita, whose sexually explicit \"Consummation of the Wedding of the Snake\" dance (performed with a live snake) and other daring performances earned her legendary status.

He critically confronts both predominant versions of today\u0027s spirituality--New Age gnosticism and deconstructionist-Levinasian Judaism--and then tries to redeem the \"materialist\" kernel of Christianity. His reading of Christianity is explicitly political, discerning in the Pauline community of believers the first version of a revolutionary collective. Since today even advocates of Enlightenment like Jurgen Habermas acknowledge that a religious vision is needed to ground our ethical and political stance in a \"postsecular\" age, this book--with a stance that is clearly materialist and at the same time indebted to the core of the Christian legacy--is certain to stir controversy.","isbn10":"0262740257","average_rating":"383","categories":"Philosophy","title":"The Puppet and the Dwarf","ratings_count":"617","authors":"Slavoj Žižek;Žižek;Stockholm Inst Of Transition Staff;Mladen Dolar;Alenka Zupancic"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":206.59786987304688,"y":440.89947509765625,"id":"1788","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dJ51bOQAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1991","isbn13":"9,78035E+12","subtitle":"A Graphic Novel","num_pages":"404","description":"Lestat recounts the story of how he became a vampire in eighteenth-century France","isbn10":"0345373944","average_rating":"419","categories":"Humor","title":"Anne Rice\u0027s the Vampire Lestat","ratings_count":"67983","authors":"Faye Perozich;Anne Rice;Daerick Gross"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-29.32381820678711,"y":440.07720947265625,"id":"527","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dMbix2qU7bwcC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2005","isbn13":"9,78007E+12","num_pages":"252","description":"Practice makes perfect Italian verb tenses goes beyond other verb books to coach you in when and why verb tenses are used.

Do great works of the imagination originate in words or in images? Is there a rational explanation for the sudden appearance of geniuses like Mozart or Einstein? Such questions have fascinated people for centuries; only in recent years, however, has cognitive psychology been able to provide some clues to the mysterious process of creativity. In this revised edition of Notebooks of the Mind, Vera John-Steiner combines imaginative insight with scientific precision to produce a startling account of the human mind working at its highest potential. To approach her subject John-Steiner goes directly to the source, assembling the thoughts of \"experienced thinkers\"--artists, philosophers, writers, and scientists able to reflect on their own imaginative patterns. More than fifty interviews (with figures ranging from Jessica Mitford to Aaron Copland), along with excerpts from the diaries, letters, and autobiographies of such gifted giants as Leo Tolstoy, Marie Curie, and Diego Rivera, among others, provide illuminating insights into creative activity. We read, for example, of Darwin\u0027s preoccupation with the image of nature as a branched tree while working on his concept of evolution. Mozart testifies to the vital influence on his mature art of the wondrous \"bag of memories\" he retained from childhood. Anais Nin describes her sense of words as oppressive, explaining how imagistic free association freed her as a writer. Adding these personal accounts to laboratory studies of thought process, John-Steiner takes a refreshingly holistic approach to the question of creativity. What emerges is an intriguing demonstration of how specific sociocultural circumstances interact with certain personality traits to encourage the creative mind. Among the topics examined here are the importance of childhood mentor figures; the lengthy apprenticeship of the talented person; and the development of self- expression through highly individualistic languages, whether in images, movement or inner speech. Now, with a new introduction, this award-winning book provides an uniquely broad-based study of the origins, development and fruits of human inspiration.","isbn10":"0195108965","average_rating":"381","categories":"Psychology","title":"Notebooks of the Mind","ratings_count":"17","authors":"Vera John-Steiner"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-303.50970458984375,"y":-458.9872131347656,"id":"1272","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dlhatgvXw0JcC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,7802E+12","num_pages":"384","description":"Illustrating her ideas with hundreds of examples, Williams takes her lessons on creative design, highly regarded within the graphics community, and applies them to the Web.

In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy\u0027s fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces. Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse\u0027s crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a \"data haven\" in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe\u0027s tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn. A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson\u0027s most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow.

Instead, the dark-haired beauty became immortalized in the headlines as the \"Black Dahlia\" when her nude and bisected body was discovered in the weeds of a vacant lot. Despite the efforts of more than four hundred police officers and homicide investigators, the heinous crime was never solved. Now, after endless speculation and false claims, bestselling author Donald H. Wolfe discovers startling new evidence—buried in the files of the Los Angeles District Attorney\u0027s Office for more than half a century. With the aid of archival photos, news clippings, and investigative reports, Wolfe documents the riveting untold story that names the brutal murderer—the notorious Mafia leader, Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel—and the motive—an unwanted pregnancy resulting from Short\u0027s involvement with the most powerful figure in Los Angeles, Norman Chandler. But Wolfe goes even further to unravel the large-scale cover-up behind the case. Wolfe\u0027s extensive research, based on the evidence he discovered in the recently opened LADA files, makes The Black Dahlia Files the authoritative work on the murder that has drawn endless scrutiny but remained unsolved—until now.","isbn10":"0060582502","average_rating":"373","categories":"True Crime","title":"The Black Dahlia Files","ratings_count":"600","authors":"Don Wolfe"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-226.2166748046875,"y":-342.7823486328125,"id":"1048","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dAp2kpWhee8cC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2006","isbn13":"9,78014E+12","num_pages":"344","description":"Presents a collection of inspirational poems by such authors as Emily Dickinson, Billy Collins, Robert Frost, and Raymond Carver.","isbn10":"0143037676","average_rating":"414","categories":"Poetry","title":"Good Poems for Hard Times","ratings_count":"2611","authors":"Garrison Keillor"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":346.7389221191406,"y":-490.7579345703125,"id":"399","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d_ccsPwAACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"1999","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"336","description":"As S\u0026M photographer Jared Poe waits on Louisiana\u0027s Death Row to be executed for the murder of his lover, he can not imagine that his search for the true killer will continue after his death in the shadowy realm of The Crow","isbn10":"0061020095","average_rating":"373","categories":"Fiction","title":"The Crow: The Lazarus Heart","ratings_count":"1334","authors":"Poppy Z.

With only 24 hours available to solve the mystery, Hercule Poirot recalled a chance remark he\u0027d overheard back in Jerusalem: \u0027You see, don\u0027t you, that she\u0027s got to be killed?\u0027 Mrs Boynton was, indeed, the most detestable woman he\u0027d ever met...","isbn10":"0007119356","average_rating":"373","categories":"Detective and mystery stories","title":"Appointment with Death","ratings_count":"24859","authors":"Agatha Christie"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-328.9815368652344,"y":-390.6287841796875,"id":"1516","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dekrNJWcrsvgC\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2004","isbn13":"9,78031E+12","num_pages":"322","description":"After a night of indiscriminate partying, Rachel sleeps with a close friend\u0027s fianc and is consumed with guilt, until the intensity of her feelings forces her to make a difficult choice.

Jolted out of his comfortable routine, Merton is forced to reassess his need for love and his commitment to celibacy and the monastic vocation.This astonishing volume traces Merton’s struggle to reconcile his unexpected love with his sacred vows while continuing to grapple with the burning social issues of the day – including racial conflicts, the war in Vietnam, and the Arab-Israeli conflict – visiting and corresponding with high-profile friends like Thich Nhat Hanh and Joan Baez, and further developing his writing career. Revealing Merton to be ‘very human’ in his chronicles of the ecstasy and torment of being in love, Learning to Love comes full circle as Merton recommits himself completely and more deeply to his vocation even as he recognizes ‘my need for love, my loneliness, my inner division, the struggle in which solitude is at once a problem and a ‘solution’. And perhaps not a perfect solution either’ (11 May, 1967).","isbn10":"0060654856","average_rating":"373","categories":"Religion","title":"Learning to Love","ratings_count":"15","authors":"Thomas Merton"},"color":"rgb(0,0,0)","size":10.0},{"x":-500.9241027832031,"y":173.32879638671875,"id":"516","attributes":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dvDTJwAEACAAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","published_year":"2002","isbn13":"9,78006E+12","num_pages":"464","description":"Strange things happen at Hexwood Farm.
